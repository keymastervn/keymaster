## Say hello to Obsidian
- [ ] Hello
	- it does not need to be a todo nested inside a todo
- I can turn on live preview/ or reading
- Remember there are backlinks at @mention and link
	- Let's create a graph dependency to visualize the relationship better than any words
- As markdown, it can play well with mermaidjs
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  root[Kafka Cluster]-->pull[pull messages within Topic:\nAuthentication.Session.Signout]
  pull-->del_user_device_info[find user_device_info with\n user_id and device_id \nfrom the pulled message]
  del_user_device_info-->del[delete the user_device_info]
  del-->endd[end]
```
- :trophy: emojis, let's see
- github / source versioning friendly 
	- ga . && gcsm "$(date +%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S%Z)"
