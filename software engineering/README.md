Software Engineering is a [major field of study](https://www.usief.org.in/US-Fields-of-Study.aspx), it has siblings such as "Electrical Engineering" or "Computer Science". 

The hierarchy of knowledge, specialized in order
- major
- minor
- subject
- topic
- concept 

The more specialized unit, the more it is likely to change.
The top generalized knowledge will be looks as theoretical knowledge
The down specialized knowledge eg. topic, concept can be approached with tools. But here I reaffirm that _focusing on tools is not helping you catchup with the expand of knowledge in long-term_. So I suggest you to look up at `subject`, the upper minor and lower `topics` to balance your road to knowledge, knowing vs making.

We start creating things from bottom-up, I mean concepts. Many things are easily described than done in Software Engineering. Be specific!

Similar to life in which it is giving you tests before a lesson, we learn by our observation and analysis skill, maping topic to topic, knowing what it is, where it is placed and the good practices in the field. You are focused and progressive in your own pace.

Go.
