	- High Reliability Organizations (HROs) are organizations that achieve safety, quality, and efficiency goals by employing 5 central principles: (1) **sensitivity to operations** (ie, heightened awareness of the state of relevant systems and processes); (2) **reluctance to simplify** (ie, the acceptance that work is complex, with the potential to fail in new and unexpected ways); (3) **preoccupation with failure** (ie, to view near misses as opportunities to improve, rather than proof of success); (4) **deference to expertise** (ie, to value insights from staff with the most pertinent safety knowledge over those with greater seniority); (5) and **practicing resilience** (ie, to prioritize emergency training for many unlikely, but possible, system failures)
