	- t=6:00 people (Chinese) value knowledge a lot, Confucian society
	- t=10:00, there are many people, different views, there are still many culture differences that we need to understand them, the ways we approach problems are different, but just the ways we approach them.
		- t=11:03 "for me, may be a little less biased towards action, but for Chinese, they are more action"
	- t=11:30 on freedom on Chinese
	- t=19:32 "I'll never be a chinese person" part, interesting!
	- t=22:50 "if you speak more than two languages, your brain tends to develop, and in brain scans you look slightly more schizophrenic. Because can you can have a slightly different personality... China made me a little more outgoing" -> same to Vietnam.
