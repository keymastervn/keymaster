			- So, I am thinking of remote centralized tool server. In this scenario, the tool client eg. Cursor/Goose must have an decryption key locally. So user A and user B can use one common MCP server, with encrypted API-key. This way is much much safer. Because I don't want user A to create a PR using user B's Github account or slack around with the token. This universal API key with a dedicated tool server will cost a lot of servers. Cool, but well.

Accessing these events consistently across platforms often involves complex, platform-specific code."
	- Guess good for self-collecting data
	- it knows the App, the events and what/how we type. The era of our own self-agent is near. Still not excellent like real time screen parsing by vision LLMs, but in terms of latency, this is just enough.

	- t=6:27 "the fundamental of Girard's reading is that China and US are not fighting because they are too different, they're fighting because they've become indistinguishably similar." -> "two forms of capitalism that become more and more similar"
		- I think, they China know "the meta" to play the winner's game better than the winner, that's how they are similar
		- the "narcissism of small differences"
	- t=10:50 "capitalism and human nature are driven off relative social desires and not absolute material desires. As a result, by bringing China and US closer, similarity rather than difference is going to be the new catalyst of genuine conflict"
		- on "why the trade wars will descend into real wars", it is "Girard's understanding of law": "a thing that all civilizations need to develop is a way to prevent reciprocal violence from spiraling out of control: I kill you, your brother kills me, my family kills your brother, on and on". "The mechanism that early countries use is to discharge this violence by selecting a relatively innocent party or group and expelling that". 
		- "In societies that have law, they are no longer practice these kinds of violent rituals"
			- tế đàn, lễ, something wicked, but it boosts up morale is a fact. Deep inside our mentality, we want sacrifices
		- and "the guity party can't be punished but innocent, for things like law, but lawlike"

- Katechon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katechon): The katechon (from Greek: τὸ κατέχον, "that which withholds", or ὁ κατέχων, "the one who withholds") is a biblical concept that subsequently developed into a notion of political philosophy. Mentioned in the New Testament, the katechon is of uncertain identity and has been debated amongst Christian scholars. Common interpretations for the identity include the government, the church, and the Holy Spirit
