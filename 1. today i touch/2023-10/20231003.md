- Same to async vs. sync, ahead-of-time vs. just-in-time: Generate/build data vs. Fetch/aggregate data just-in-time is a solution and still a problem. Every move needs to be reasoned well because every misstep hurts the design severely, we don't know.

	- I think, people get hard to understand what Agile actually means. Because when you adopt a workflow welcoming unexpected changes doesn't mean that you can add changes constantly. It comes with the reduced cost of pre-planning (that crystalizes everything then sometimes breaks hard) in exchange of just-do-it (Nike's mantra) and then we will finalise things later based on the fact of everything you know about the world previously is wrong, always, when building products. We are more capable to react properly to changes because the time spent for novelty planning is reduced, it is the art of working and planning in the same time.
		- Of course, plan is the first-class citizen in my culture. But business plan is more complex and dev's plan is very straightforward. You can't say let's implement A or B without any plan. It must be somehow without concrete, extremely detailed, very low-level planning [20231011 updated] in a proper context.
			- eg. a Football match plan must be agile, because you react on the opponent's movement, a chess game of the master is no longer a plan, it is purely "the flow" with many posibilities ahead
