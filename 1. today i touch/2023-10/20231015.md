	- You should walk 7500 steps a day, should be less than 12000 and more than 4000 (but 4000 is just enough) or it lowers your mortality.
	- So, scientifically, you should walk more (4000 a day), then perform a 5K as moderate training. At 10K, it has a lot of benefits especially mental health. Beside writing, running reduces my overthinking and it helps me create good moods.
- https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/South%20Africa.pdf in 1981 due to the spreadout of AIDS, the South Africa government reached to the US to buy some medicine. Due to the reason that "the cost of making the medicine is huge", the US corporations wanted to sell it at an unacceptable price that SA couldn't afford.
	- Later, SA reached to India to buy a less effective, cheap version. Then, the spreadout was in controlled, the domino was stopped.
	- The US 's patent holders made a lawsuit to protect their profit, pointing directly to SA.
	- The world's streets stood up against the pharma corps, they raised their voice about the IP issue, protecting SA. The pharma corps exited, SA won.

	- I don't think patent mechanism is a good thing. No thing can be yours just because it is "invented" by you. It is yours because you currently hold it. Music needs to be bought by going to concerts, making a concert should be a no gambling (sadly it does now), same to Cinematography, watching movie should not be a painful session. Just because republishing a movie is easy so you are afraid of losing profit hence promoting Intellectual Property, then everything must be IP. 
	- IP is a not-so-good design, it made parasites and muddy context. It does not fit everything, some monopolies will make it looks fit without proper investments... They will say they spent a lot but indeed become a parasite of both makers and consumers. Breaking improper IPs needs some revolutions.
- Không được dùng thánh nhân để bắt kẻ tội đồ - "Never use a saint to catch a sinner". Người xấu thường không tử tế với nhau, cách tốt nhất vẫn là để chúng tự triệt tiêu nhau; nếu không thì phải có những người sẵn sàng xấu xí để triệt tiêu chúng. Không có ranh giới rõ ràng giữa thánh nhân và tội đồ, ai cũng có tội, kể cả thánh nhân, nhưng thái độ cho thấy một kẻ là kẻ có tội hay là một thánh nhân.
