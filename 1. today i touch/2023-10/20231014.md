- Naming is hard because once it is embodied, it becomes rooted in our nerves and is impossible to unthink. Repetition for memory overriding is the only way to stop thinking about that name, but one one know how many times it will take to override a community's naming of something.
- Conceptualisation is hard because it is impossible to know whether our ideas are <s>right</s> good enough or not, also how to deal with "future ideas" when having no idea about it and how to deal with "current biases" when the affected cohorts are having different beliefs.

		- "The conceptualization process is all the more important because of the imprecision, vagueness, and ambiguity of many social science constructs. For instance, is “compassion” the same thing as “empathy” or “sentimentality”? If you have a proposition stating that “**compassion is positively related to empathy**”, you cannot test that proposition unless you can conceptually separate empathy from compassion and then empirically measure these two very similar constructs correctly"

		- Guess what, the money WON'T COME much to the author but the corporation. Do you guess how much money a Singer/Performer can take from Spotify? Or it is just another tentacle for the big three: UMG, WMG, SME. They are parasites, they has been killing every culture.
	- Deep in the local context, "artists in the Southern" is a gang. They overly politicise everything related to art and is becoming more dangerous to the indie movement.
