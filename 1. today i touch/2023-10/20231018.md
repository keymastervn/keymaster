- The time when I took time-off, I reduced 90% of my work stress. Even when I wanted to work on the next day. It's a very important psychology trick to have no-meeting days or pseudo leave, it feels like the last resort for serenity, it heals a lot.

	- Efficiency, interval and focus
		- Learning efficiency is about the (R - knowledge retention x L - level of knowledge) and (U - how we use the knowledge for  your need) than information retrieval. (RxL)xU% = LE - learning efficiency
		- Mentally speaking, we should study hard for the first 30 min, take a short break, then study, then stop. In my way, I need to plan my study for 60 min only with item A,B,C. Then move to the next day. I will try to reason the concept, understand its context and map it to a quick analogy, justify it as a god, then forget; the benefit of actively forget is you/your shadow will passively remember. (Basically, we can't forget thing actively, it is a super skill)
		- t=360 high-order thinking
		- t=480 the context-switch, I have written about it [once](https://www.facebook.com/lifeleech/posts/pfbid02gJzvMmVj1nUCE5FesbtnY7cJ2C7YMEmhnnkwhGYTnrjno3QNKH5htrDZJQeMdFULl?__tn__=%2CO*F). In short, don't work/study in your bed room, it slowly kills your learning and sleeping.
		- t=868 concepts != facts, *oversimplify* concepts is bad because we have to understand the impact and implication of concepts => concept mastery

	- ![[Pasted image 20231019002647.png]] Interestingly, Basecamp spent a lot of money for OpenSearch, it was almost 3/4 RDS, EC2 is not being much of the cake.
	- https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-price-of-managed-cloud-services-4f33d67e
		- $43,333 monthly, replaced by
		- about $150,000 to buy the hardware we needed ($75,000 per data center, for full redundancy), and if we depreciate this over five years, that's about $2,500/month. It costs us another ~$2,500/month for the power, space, and networking to operate these machines across our two data centers. So call it an even five grand, which includes a bit of a buffer as well. (not counting cost of dev maintainer)
		- In this journey, Basecamp win, we - EH is also a passive winner. Cloud vendors are just meh :\
- Database is a temple.
