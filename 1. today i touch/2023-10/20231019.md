- "When utilization of the system is between 0 and 70%, queue wait times increase quite slowly as utilization increases. But, when utilization increases beyond 70%, the exponential effects take over and queue latency increases quickly"

	- Gaza has been outlawful: it is the biggest prison in the world, a real holocaust. Extremists are about to counter extremists, it is not a safe and peaceful land, everything is manipulated. So when an evil thing happens there are two things (1) how did it truly start? (2) how to end the running cycle?
	- The way the interview raised these questions is disgusting.
- I don't think that there is a good complex design for everything. A good design is a simple design; a nature design which has been truncating its nonsenses and being kept only the necessities; eventually, it is a simple design. You can say let's keep the interfaces simple and make the implementations complex but basically both can be simple.
	- Principles of programming have been just philosophies. http://principles-wiki.net/principles:start how many principles here is to implement complex structure? No, it is to get the work done with simple things.

	- If you feel the existing code isn't simple enough, let's refactor it to be simple enough rather than adding more flows to keep "the one" interface. That "the one" interface seems good theoretically (on the Law of Demeter) but is full of evil without refactoring. Having one interface for what when its inner implementations are complex flows?
		- A sign to reject complex business reqs as well, it is not natural. Cheat implementations for complex reqs have a pattern to extend before and after like proxy, not in the middle flows. How to call it in OOP? I don't know, it's perhaps strategy pattern.
