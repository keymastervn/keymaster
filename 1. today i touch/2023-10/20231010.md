	- https://youtu.be/lqwDld2R3Tg?t=410 straightface to those who said drones are useless. This modern warfare favors top three things (1) drones, UAVs (2) night vision optics and (3) glide bombs. Alongside with other sub-favourites, many of them are based on the famous Asymmetrical warfare focusing on only one word "cost-effectiveness" to run the war machine. The most <s>dangerous</s> fearsome drones are those built by carton and duct tape with an acceptable efficiency, it is a game changer as now you don't need to be a super power to have air superiority.
	- Now it is another smart move ![[Pasted image 20231010151252.png]] the CHEAP mobilized paratroopers with less training. Brilliantly, it is two-way tactics as they are capable to flight back while traditional paratroopers can only be bought back by helicopters or re-group with infantry. It is pickup-mounting gun style which is costing only 10K per unit.

	- "But my read on a lot of the Unity crisis, as a long-time game industry veteran myself, was that one of the increasingly common "management consulting" / investor- & revenue-focused type of gaming executives (e.g. Riccitiello, Don Mattrick [Zynga replacement CEO when Pincus stepped down], Kotick [Activision-Blizzard]) had finally overstepped their bounds and let revenue goals drive decision-making just a bit too far without customer consideration." => the game industry is no longer for fun, it is becoming the new music industry where some old big corporations are monopolizing it and becoming more or less parasites.
