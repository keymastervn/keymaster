- https://youtu.be/OsYtZCLBO9k?si=8rCfnj6P0WAmTkAB&t=897 Russia's self-claimed 4274 KIA, perhaps 8-10K (2x conventionally for more real) unrecoverable casualties vs. 70K Ukr. 10-to-1 :\
	- Let's check the ratio I have written on 20230728, 10-to-1 is a disaster that can lead to a defeat. My guesstimation at that time was 5-to-1 for the attacker, maybe I've underestimated how Western "supervisor" historically sucked.
	- It's your land Ukr, but you only used your men's blood, it's the mentality of a loser.
