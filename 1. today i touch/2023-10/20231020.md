	- It is very much dynamic, it makes data (in-mem or commited) interact deeply with UI logic. Not sure but I guess
		- It preloads the UI logic in-memory somehow, shared across processes for keeping the state clean (never good websocket for this solution), but it should not fully be persisted into DB due to extremely nested joins
			- rule of thumb: stay away from more than 6-level associations.
	- but Google failed acquiring Salesforce, what are they doing?

	- In reality, RAM is gigantically faster, DDR5 with bus 5200 Mhz is a standard

	- True, I still open two speadsheet and copy instead of using CLI. Or in the good old days, `INSERT INTO` 2 tables :lmao: then export.

	- "Ward describes debt as **the natural result of writing code about something we don't have a proper understanding of**"... "_disagreement_ between business needs and how the software has been written"............... "Requirements may still be met on the surface, but something is wrong under the hood — an abstraction that doesn't fit, some duplication, scalability issues" => 
	- Tech debt or bad design is inevitable if we don't know about the business reqs good enough. And the business reqs are still evolving, but your design can not evolve properly due to wrong abstractions.
		- BUT MANY TIMES, I SEE BUSINESS REQS CREATE 2 FLOWS FOR 1 THING (PERHAPS UX), MANY TIMES DEV ARE ASKED TO BREAK THEIR CONSISTENCY for requirements. In these scenarios, the only thing we can do is to convince product people to make it consistent, but if our voice were not strong enough then an evil is born :D
		- It is like the Onboarding flow, the good way is to reduce dependencies so quick_onboard is a smaller combination, while full_onboard as the steps don't/less depend on others is just another big combination.
	- Solid design, on the other hand, is the most struggling thing for devs. When being deprecated, it feels like killing your own beautiful daughter.
