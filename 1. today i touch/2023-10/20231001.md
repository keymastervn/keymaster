- https://stosa.org/ strong code ownership like this will eventually give birth to so many services. I am unsure whether this is good or bad.
- https://www.polyscale.ai/ how can you invalidate DB cache, is it a change detector for invalidator? or CDC?
	- https://docs.polyscale.ai/how-does-it-work#smart-invalidation
	- "PolyScale is plug and play and uses fully autonomous caching that requires no code to implement, and zero configuration and tuning" -> I simply love easy stuff like this.

	- p2: "I see this place, it's crazy, it looks like a clown show and yet, things are working really well"
	- p3: "I just said, “I'm going to try and be a programmer and I'm going to watch what people do. I'm just going to copy what they do..." yeah, because FB have an unseen culture, it's a true hacker culture, they have hackathon, they have spent 20 billions to buy Whatsapp which is also a hack lmao
	- p4: "I started this coaching program called good to great and began working with engineers one on one. Ended up coaching maybe a 150 or 200 engineers... ...You have very little to lose in that moment. This is where move fast and break things is exactly the right attitude to take. If you have nothing to lose, breaking something has no cost, so just go"
		- DE are having some barriers, we was on unstable headcount and can't be open/assertive/honest enough, we can't sit down and talk about how can we become great, we are somewhat amber reaching orange...
	- p5: now I can see (1) exploration phase (2) growth phase, (3) expand phase. "A couple of people would peel off and just start trying stuff in some area that they were interested in. That's the explore phase. Something they did would take off and start growing quickly, and then the infrastructure would fall over because it was a new – some new demand. People would join the project who didn't like trying out new things, but loved diving into hairy, technical, unprecedented technical problems"
	- p7: "Facebook is very metrics-oriented company"
	- p8: "I think the extreme programming was an attempt to get away from big upfront planning, or to put it positively, to move decisions to where they could most effectively be made, instead of piling them up in big batches either too early or too late"
	- p9: "...The folks that I talk to now that are trying to create a culture from scratch, that mythology of well, think really hard about your infrastructure, because you don't want to be in a position where you want to scale and you can't scale" -> Kent didn't buy the idea that somebody perhaps Principle Architect draft up everything then start building, and may fail. It must be a lot of iteration
		- "There was a poster of Facebook that said, “Nothing at Facebook is somebody else's problem.” That's the foundation of Facebook engineering culture. **If you saw something, you wouldn't necessarily just go fix it, because you can't solve all problems. If you didn't, it's because you chose not to**" -> yes, true, yes, some kinds of problem ain't worth the investment. In problem solving, we have to think similarly to risk management: impact and likelihood, missing one factor isn't worth.
	- p11: "if that ratio is skewed towards hey, stuff only fails in production, then don't write any tests." -> I am curious on how they can trust code review instead of writing test.
		- "Then logging and operational awareness was just part of the engineering culture, so you'd get feedback post-production of how your feature actually was behaving. There's a bunch of feedback loops in place. Unit tests occupied for most development of Facebook, just the cost benefit, the amount of feedback they added and the timeliness of the that feedback and the most of achieving that feedback just wasn't worth it." -> simply trust eg. Sentry? Somehow, this is the fastest way to launch. 
		- At Reapra, we did not always write tests, especially frontend tests as frontend is prone to change AND is reliable (it works then it works and we should only test important state); there were some crucial backend tests, the test coverage was just 30-50%, while test coverage at EH is ~96%. This is the major different between zero-to-one (product market-fit) and microservices (proven business).
			- But without test, refactoring is a nightmare, that's why facebook were globally 5xx so many times. "you probably wouldn't want to take that approach to nuclear power plant software, or electricity grid software" -> yeah, because those businesses are very sensitive and important.
			- I like the idea that when a test failed (flaky maybe), it should be commented out right immediately. The business needs to move on instead of being stuck by a sting. I think tools like CircleCI or our rspec-cli should have a stateful way to temporarily exclude bad tests instead of modifying code.
			- "making decisions reversible" is a super power, but it is a feasible superpower in Software Engineering. We must acknowledge and embrace it, we have all protocols to keep us safe from catastrophic failures, bank people will dream of this.
				- https://theathletic.com/4915926/2023/09/30/liverpool-tottenham-var-dias-explained/ for example, this is a human error that is irreversible.
					- Previously, referees blew whistle just-in-time, but now they do after-time (I can't find a specific term, mb **validate**-**revalidate**-**reinvalidate** in frontend [SWR](https://www.toptal.com/react-hooks/stale-while-revalidate)), because a wrong decision can't be reverted with just-in-time due to the _ephemeral context_ (context can be kept easily with software engineering).
					- We human, with our regard and respect, will say sorry at most, the context will never be exactly reverted at the time a wrong choice is made. It can't be undone easily.
	- p13: "There's a beautiful article by Yu Sheng Wang about Facebook's early engineering management philosophy. I can't recall the title of it. Maybe we can find it later. The upshot is Facebook deliberately chose to make engineering easier and the engineering management harder. If there was ever a tradeoff, they would make the manager’s life harder and the engineer’s life and job easier."

	- p14: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpFH9X_Fb8k "There's a fantastic video presentation that he gave this, only available inside of Facebook that I insisted all my students watch, because it was just"
	- p17: "Last question, what do you miss most about working at Facebook?" => "Scale. Just that leverage, that first feature that I shipped was a civil union and domestic partnership became relationship types" -> glad as you are not the one who introduced type "helicopter" :D
		- "Honestly, if I had to put money on it, I don't – because everybody is so focused on impact and impact is this magic word at Facebook and if you don't have impact, you're fired. If you do have impact, you're rewarded. Everybody's looking for that upside. Those upsides are getting smaller and smaller, but the downsides are getting bigger and bigger. Culturally, how do you unwind that? I would guess that they won't be able to."
- Tuan Thieu before his leaving, he told me to be more friendly and calm towards people, he said that my rogue attitude is not good. I know, bro, I am still taming myself.
