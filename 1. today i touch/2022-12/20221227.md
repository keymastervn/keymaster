- On meetings, we work on agenda, not time. We only cut off agenda if it exceeds time; and we cut of excessive time when all agenda are done. Can cheat it with Q&A, but it is not agenda.

	- 1.  1.  Look at repos for Gitlab & Mastadon. See how theyâ€™re organizing code, using services & scaling. :thinking: 
		- https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon
			- https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/workers/cache_buster_worker.rb some concepts
			- https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/appeal_service.rb#L3 their service object, base services have no init method, it means they have to `.new.call`, still looks fine.
				- https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/536d55c6ad7f496cc54c66ca9a7f91fcea020f84/app/controllers/disputes/appeals_controller.rb#L9
				- not all services has error handling https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/reject_follow_service.rb#L7, see `find_by!`
					- so their baseController handles them all https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/536d55c6ad7f496cc54c66ca9a7f91fcea020f84/app/controllers/api/base_controller.rb#L39-L82, some can capture errors neatly like L67, L80.
			- no decorator :like:, but 3 presentational abstracts:
				- [helpers](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/helpers/accounts_helper.rb) -> view rendering
				- [presenters](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/presenters/filter_result_presenter.rb) -> for model
				- [serializers](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/serializers/manifest_serializer.rb) -> for render json at controller
					- https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/concerns/payloadable.rb#L15 somehow, an serializer is a concern at service layer.
