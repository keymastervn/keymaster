- BugReporter as a Sentry wrapper
```
FFA.bug_reporter = BugReporter
Eh::XXX.configure { |config| config.bug_reporter = BugReporter }
YYY.configure { |config| config.bug_reporter = BugReporter }
```
injected to a gem as a configurable
```
class Config
  attr_writer :bug_reporter
  def bug_reporter
    @bug_reporter ||= ''
  end
end
```
and exec on exception
```
def report_bug(exception, uri, params, method)
  config.bug_reporter.notify(
    exception,
    parameters: {
      uri: u,
      exception_body: b,
      request_method: m,
      request_params_base64: Base64.encode64(p.to_s)
    },
    from: SENTRY_SOURCE
  )
end
```
so as an add-on, it would use the application host to fire sentry issue
- if you try to sync to make sure of consistency, you will need to define "first-class citizen" resource. Eg. a Job Application, so all changes related to Job Applications, members (filtered recruiters), users (filtered candidates), organisations (filtered recruiting org), and additional infos like "settings" should be synchronized as well
	- but if there are delta changes, and you need more eg users (filtered partner), org (filtered while label), how would you deal with the initial sync? Does it crash?
	- no, it should not be crashed, instead it should be practically tested, like "chaos monkey". A system should be designed to accept all situation. So when next sync comes, it will be a real test.
