	- also, if you are confused about decorator and presenter and serializers, see their [definitions](https://nimblehq.co/compass/development/code-conventions/ruby/ruby-on-rails/#decorators)
		- Decorators are POROs abstracting **view methods from models**.
		- Presenters are POROs abstracting view methods from models, controllers and views.
		- Serializers are POROs handling **API responses rendering**.
		- =====
		- but I rarely see people keeping more than two view abstractions in a codebase. Most of the time there are serializers, very fat serializers. Or presenters have been put wrongly at helper (helper is terrible), or no such thing called decorators, but methods placing at model, or serializers.
