- Tech debts will slowly kill you, if you don't treat complete-migration as a serious thing :D
	- more specifically, you prefer on-the-go migration, keeping two versions of data and two versions of logic, and hope shit A schema won't clash shit B logic.
	- and, you are more likely to blame POs on putting more logic to it.
	- next, you are afraid of breaking changes, you want to do strong migration, right? So you want to fallback?
	- but, if you have two flows that can handle two types of data. Why not monitoring, controlling everything when it is observable? You end-up keeping everything there indefinitely.
