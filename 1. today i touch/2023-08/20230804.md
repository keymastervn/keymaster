	- zero electricity resistance in normal conditions, and the material LK-99, is said to be affordable and easy to make. So it is a breaking news to the scientist world.

		- "For superconductivity to occur, the entropy must be low. However, the entropy of electrons does not decrease well even if the temperature is lowered. The method is to uniformly restrict the position, momentum, and movement pattern, and the most ideal thing is to make it move uniformly like a military division. In other words, it means that it should be confined in a narrow space and only vibrated in place"
