	- I think I am both grieving and still, dancing near the abyss. It's better avoiding Di-lemma, but once it hopelessly come, the only thing we can do is to dance. 
	- So do Oppenheimer, he is a dangerous motif; somehow, honest, brave people like Teller can sense him intrinsically but to criticise him is a serious mistake, Oppenheimer is being criticised already, and it is fortunately unfair already, how dilemma!
	- "_dangerousness_ like Nietzsche life and fate... the decisive _abandonment of security_ by Nietzsche and his propensity to take an ever more self-destructive _tightrope walk_", Teller, somehow promoted Oppie. "Philosophy in the 20th century was profoundly shaken and inspired by Nietzsche’s books, but in his life, as Zweig points out, he was eaten alive, bit by bit, by the demon of solitude."

	- Nỗi đau luôn truy cầu nguyên do, và sự sung sướng cố hữu thì phải cứ tiếp diễn. "Một nỗi đau đồ sộ sẽ là kẻ giải phóng cuối cùng của tinh thần, nó đơn độc ép buộc chúng ta chìm sâu vào tận cùng của một cái đáy". Chả trách, sự trauma của ông thai nghén nihilism. Nếu ông có thể khóc lóc, thì ông đã có một cái nhà để về, hay tối thiểu phải là một tinh thần sáng sủa, một chiến binh chứ không phải một anh hùng đơn độc, mất trí, ngạo mạn và đáng thương. Ông gạt bỏ mọi thứ, có thực sự là gạt bỏ mọi thứ không khi ông thật sự gạt bỏ nổi bản thân mình?

	- "Listen—God only exists in people’s minds. Especially in Japan, God’s always been kind of a flexible concept. Look at what happened after the war. Douglas MacArthur ordered the divine emperor to quit being God, and he did, making a speech saying he was just an ordinary person"
	- In your own spiritual world, the first thing to do is believe, let's believe in whatever occurs there. Even when you've found a doppelganger there; it's real, don't resist, let's talk, it's a full of luck when you find yourself at the first place... it's even higher of luck when you are finding yourself who is desperate in creating a spiritual world and think he/she has now found you. You think that there are 3 people, but it's just two: Dat Le and the Key Master.
