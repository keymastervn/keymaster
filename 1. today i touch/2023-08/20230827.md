- In your corporate life, everyone of us will eventually focus on two simple tactics:
	- credibility (or visibility): get as much as possible people who (1) know you and (2) trust you 
	- impact: your true value that you have to earn it
	- they lead you to what you should do at a time. Mostly, credibility will be approached first, but if you have earned it through your high-ranked title, impact must be considered first. 
		- Impact needs timing, it's hard to describe what is impact's timing, but it's an art of keeping things in proper awareness (for true escalation) before taking action AND aligning time for micro and macro context.
		- If you are junior and you focus on impact, your deliverables are likely occupied by another people. It's a mixed feelings but it happens very much. Most juniors can't overcome this feeling.
- It's hard to know how much is enough to kick-off in something, it's an art.
