- On last Sunday on problem solving, I told Toan that "when you've get only one approach for a problem, then you should ask people around for more approaches, when you have 4 approaches and up then there must be at least 2 problems"
	- eg. to promote a pawn to be a queen (queen gambit), most people think that there are just one, but in deed there are two approaches
		- Usually, move the pawn to the last row, or

			- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_2-category as category is a meta-concept, a morphism can carry other morphisms like math and problems (-solving) embrace (or clearer, inject) themselves into other's body in a bigger context. That's somehow explain the meaning of "meta".

			- the mind has the ability to reason about its own concepts
			- "Kant also argued that the mind has certain _a priori_ concepts, which are concepts that are not learned from experience. These concepts include the concepts of space, time, cause, and effect.

		- Comparing the the Free-rider problem, it is due to the rivalry of people to maximize their benefit leading to depleted resources.
			- the Free-rider problem: a naive market that believes people can take something (surplus) from other without paying anything, eventually it fails.
			- So, when someone is able to get something for free, you have to be terrified.
		- Solution perhaps: distribute resources, make earning people yield future resources as responsibility, stop by make nothing free at all or punish the free-riders.
