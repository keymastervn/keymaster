	- "Managing people is hard; much harder than programming. Computers just do what you tell them, whether that’s right or wrong (usually wrong). Anyone can get good at programming, if they’re willing to put in enough time and effort. I’m not sure anyone can get good at managing, and most don’t. Most managers are _terrible_."
	- "Good managers, then, like good teachers, are rare, but all the more precious for it. If you’ve ever had a really good boss, you’ll remember them all your life, and, if you’re lucky, emulate them. (You’ll remember the really bad ones, too.) And just because managers don’t cut code or solder chips, it doesn’t mean they don’t have a big influence on the success of projects and companies."
		- "If you want to become a great manager ... Learn people skills, communication, collaboration, psychology. Work on understanding the things that make different kinds of people tick. Manage _yourself_ excellently"

	- "I'm Ryan Worl, co-founder and CTO of WarpStream. We're super excited to announce our Developer Preview of our Kafka protocol compatible streaming system built directly on top of S3 with no stateful disks/nodes to run, no rebalancing data, no ZooKeeper, and 5-10x cheaper because of no cross-AZ bandwidth charges. If you have any questions about WarpStream, my co-founder (richieartoul) and I will be here to answer them."

	- "Kafka is a closer to a persistent WAL than a message queue" -> Agree, it's a distributed WAL, with high level of fault tolerance.
	- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37038660 -> "how do you design avoiding message queues? Or do you use other alternatives around kafka for these things?"
		- "There was recently an article about distributed systems that showed up here. (Harry Doyle: Christ, I can't find it. To hell with it!)"
		- "And the author made a very interesting point about message queues. Simply, any problem that could be resolved by a message queue could be resolved by load balancing or persistence, and, therefore, messages queues were actually kind of a bad idea."
