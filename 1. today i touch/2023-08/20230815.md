	- "t=270 trauma, a false self, profoundly change his/her personality, character, outlook" leads to "repetition compulsion so they shutdown the person who threatening them"
	- "t=437 grieving undoes trauma, cuts those electric wires" => "t=746 rightful anger as pre-grieving", know how to fight for true self, like a guerilla war
	- grieve more, son, though it's a scary process. Grieving won't kill you, so you are stronger.

- Phạm Công Thiện in his book [Hố Thẳm của Tư tưởng](https://thuvienhoasen.org/a16927/ho-tham-cua-tu-tuong-pham-cong-thien) mention about "Ursprache" aka Proto-language as the first language of art. It is also the language that our mind and body are communicating.
	- German are great philosophers because they introduced so many terms into abstract definitions. Before German philosophies, most people got lost; after them, terms have been the lighthouse to anchor.
	- Phạm Công Thiện is a true genius. But I want to say that all Vietnamese are potential as we are sitting in "chân trời tư tưởng" of the West, the Chinese, the Indian. We possess the skill to understand everything easier than other people. More on that, we are all having traumatized paths passing from our history textbook, which is one of the most precious material for being potential.
		- Remember in 2020, we were invoked by the term "xâm lược" from Lee, in 1945 we were [invoked](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%9Di_k%C3%AAu_g%E1%BB%8Di_to%C3%A0n_qu%E1%BB%91c_kh%C3%A1ng_chi%E1%BA%BFn) by the terms "giặc", "cướp", "đồng bào". Deep in our consciousness, the potentials are embodied into weird but occasional concepts, which can always be provoked by poems and thought leaders.
