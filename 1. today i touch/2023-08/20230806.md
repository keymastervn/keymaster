	- Redacted (not even that pro-ru but they anti-imperalism) vs. Funker530 - Connie & co (pro-western). I personally like Connie as he sounds like me - like a speaking hammer. There is another guy who sounds similar - Bryan Vahey. Besides, Bryan has an evil laugh, Connie has his cold affection but neither of them are sentimentally warm like me. I think it is due to our different nature.
