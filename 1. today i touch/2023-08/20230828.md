	- ""Wise" and "smart" are both ways of saying someone knows what to do. The difference is that "wise" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and "smart" means one does spectacularly well in a few. That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person would have high peaks."
	- He meant: wise is a long-observed trait to general things, while smart is short-span towards specific things. Specifically, smart is like having more intelligent than someone X years in Y domain.
		- We no longer admire `sage`, now we admire `genius` (smart). But "Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive"
	- "Recently I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the ancient rule still works: **try to understand the situation as well as you can**, give the best advice you can based on your experience, and then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could. But I don't have anything like this serenity when I'm writing an essay. Then I'm worried. What if I run out of ideas? And when I'm writing, four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't get enough done."
