- "**Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority**" - Lord Acton
	- on Bus factor again
		- IMHO, having critical people ain't a bad idea, it is not bad compared to employing unnecessary people. Giving people power is not a bad idea, see above (power tends to corrupt), but bad people corrupt more than normal one... create a cycle of power or a support system for those who don't have power.
			- Absolute power is sensitive, you are absolute when you can step up and step down at your will. Great power destroys itself eventually, nothing lasts forever, until Capitalism.
		- bosses should not say "anybody can be replaced", it is hard managing people. Instead say that the business is a hydra and is resilient with many people, with less cogs.
			- you must indeed allow people to leave your business, even it is a sinking or sailing ship
