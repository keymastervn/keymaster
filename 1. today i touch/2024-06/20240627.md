- ahead-of-time, just-in-time, over-time: the 3 timing concepts we must be aware to cover Time
	- There are some kinds of re-timing, given 3 subsequently called `alpha`, `beta`, `delta` of a job every T minutes eg. T=3
	- (1) [Delayed] from t=0, `alpha` is invoked, but at t+T it will be executed
		- 1 time execution
		- Delayed + a unique distributed lock until execution => a guarantee at-most once execution

	- (2) [Delayed + Batch = Debounce] from t=0, `alpha` is executed, `beta` and `delta` is not executed but its context is aggregated, then t+T => `beta+delta` is executed
		- 2 times execution
		- must implement a persistence to capture contextual data

	- (3) [Delayed + Jitter = Throttle] `alpha`, `beta`, `delta` then alpha=t, beta=t+T, delta=t+2T ie. 0, 3, 6
		- 3 times execution
		- rescheduling jobs at a proper work load. BUT it may extend the lag to the end of this world.
