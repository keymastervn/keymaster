		- "Both the rental income and the selling value of land will tend to increase while the game population is growing, which makes it a tempting target for speculators"
		- "Georgism is, at this point in history, a well-researched economic policy. If you pore through the literature, you’ll see 140+ years of various experiments and theoretical discussions. The consensus is that these policies generally seem to work and do in fact reduce speculation. But Georgism isn’t widely implemented (yet) because real world politics sucks. The real world is full of entrenched powers that really don’t want to give up their eternal profit engines, so meaningful change has been lurching at best."

	- "What’s your management philosophy"
	- "Triết lý quản lý" sounds fancy, but it might have been one of the hardest questions. Philosophy + Something is a hard thing, like you can just say "hey I am Bill Gate, Jensen Huang, Steve Jobs" and people seem getting it easier.
	- "There’s a sad truth about software process: It’s [impossible to estimate](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000623.html) exactly how long a feature will take to build. Even half way through the project, most organizations [are off by up to a factor of 4.](http://www.construx.com/Page.aspx?hid=1648)"
	- "but when you question them on it, they don’t understand it at all. I had the CTO of a 500 person company tell me they didn’t use Scrum because it was a heavyweight process involving Gantt charts"
	- https://paulgraham.com/philosophy.html How to Do Philosophy
		- "Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that few people with exact minds have taken up the subject" => "Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?"
		- "I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery that most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart person who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it further, but for how he acted in response. Instead of quietly switching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside. He was Gorbachev"

	- The worst thing about AI is it can build a factory to make more of it. While we give birth to two sons and see politics already.

			- Problem discovery
		- People
			- Support Hiring by taking Interviews
			- Conducting tech talks
			- Support other engineers in their careers through mentoring
			- Participate in DEI (Diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives

	- Direction
		- Contributions to setting up a roadmap for your team
		- Identifying top problems, doing due diligence and research, creating RFC docs, and influencing and convincing fellow engineers to solve them
		- Look at strategic goals and figure out tactics to achieve them
	- Engineering Excellence
		- Technical stuff
		- Picking up development of some tooling or infra that enables other engineers to move faster and with better quality
- "Many companies that are abandoning performance evaluations are moving to real-time feedback systems. That is an excellent way to help people repeat their successes and learn from their failures. But it doesn’t help them—or the organization—gauge how they’re doing overall"
	- "Employees recognize that the system has flaws, but most also agreed that what they have is better than no reviews at all."
