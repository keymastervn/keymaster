	- I have to confess to myself that (1) I don't have much time (2) most people don't think like me and (3) convincing people usually is a waste of time and painful due to a self-expectation. I think it's true to you as well, let's speak sparingly, be patience, smile and charm someone first when we need to explain.
	- I don't like blaming friends or comrades, in game I only turn caplock on for assh_le opponents if they chat first, it is one of my personas. But it seems like "XXX did nothing wrong because there is no YYY rules about it" can be morally wrong, and to deal with this moral issue, I use my Excalibur sword: the personas.

	- When unleashing the ruby dragon, I am a narcissist and psychopathy. But when holding myself, I am feeling that I should join them and eventually be corrupted. Damn. Better stay away from the people. 
		- In this universal world, monkey people can't express love to tiger people due to perception, we are all people, but what motivates people when they are hungry. We are all people when we are educated and can talk at least, or at worst not in a dire extent.
	- Last synthesis, I confess that I am toxic like others.
