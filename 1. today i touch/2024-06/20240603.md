		- Recommendations are based on a number of factors, including things like:
			- **User interactions** such as the videos you like or share, accounts you follow, comments you post, and content you create.
			- **Video information**, which might include details like captions, sounds, and hashtags.
			- **Device and account settings** like your language preference, country setting, and device type. These factors are included to make sure the system is optimized for performance, but they receive lower weight in the recommendation system relative to other data points we measure since users don't actively express these as preferences.
		- All these factors are processed by our recommendation system and **weighted based on their value to a user**. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from **beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator**, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.

	- "Typically, large companies don't use a single model, but rather a large number of different models, all performing different tasks (recommending, filtering, etc). It would very difficult to describe the complete recommendations pipeline (i.e from user request to final candidate) in a single academic paper."

	- "After careful consideration, investigation, and based on battle-tested experience from applications running in production, we decided to change the [default number of threads in Puma from 5 to 3](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/7_2_release_notes.html#set-a-new-default-for-the-puma-thread-count). This change is to improve latency (request response time) by reducing the time Ruby spends waiting for the Global VM Lock (GVL) to release when the thread count is too high."
