		- => answer this question https://workingwithruby.com/wwrt/how_many_threads/#so-how-many-should-you-use 
		- like high-school graphs you have to find an optimal point of HOW MANY THREADS SHOULD WE USE
			- that's why i totally against 20 -> 50 sidekiq threads, it should be just 8-10 as always. Throughput matters but resiliency has a high price, how dare you naively break it?

		- -> scottw at f# for functional programming hates this shiet "m----" => "monad" lol
		- What exactly are you trying to solve?
		- If you’re thinking about something greater, you might consider other kinds of architecture or even something like [Eventide](https://eventide-project.org/).

		- => fucking awesome https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor/ 
		- => another fucking awesome refactoring for synchronous service execution https://github.com/adomokos/light-service 
			- it brings up **the context** as the first-class concern, with `expects` and `promises` as context assignment
			- it uses hooks (callbacks), well well well
			- then i feel interactor is enough, this too shall fail, but it is a nice concept focusing on the context 
- should use this term/analogy more: step on someone's (your own) foot. It's kinda stuck, intertwined, counter-intuitive, barely stupid, think easy please, abstraction on abstraction why you sucks
