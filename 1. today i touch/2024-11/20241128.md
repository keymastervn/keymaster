	- As a follower of the "default" God, I agree, every defaults has reasons. Firstly, perhaps it prevents us from making mistake, until we know more about what the things are. Lastly, it is the simplicity which is perhaps the finest form of perfection.

	- Let's place a bet, if 80% of the codebase has already written in a functional way, do you still feel annoyed writing in OOP? Assuming Monad is no longer a hard concept, the code base is super consistent
