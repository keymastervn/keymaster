- What should we say to stress? "only today". Deal with all sorts of things as good enough and close them.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=f1dn3-c_wZE Dr.House vs. a psychopath, a very interesting movie cut.
	- One of my other personalities has a controllable psychopathy, it is good at dumping energized vibe in anyone just to see how someone can truly maintain it as an inner source. I have been influenced by dealing with it like House, which I think eventually making I and him 10-20% psychopathic. If we were influenced by somebody has been dealing with psychopath, we are all having seeds of psychopathy. The problem is, do you ignore other feelings just to put you on top as always?
	- Dark Triad are out due to lack of empathy before being manipulative.
	- "Not only do real psychopaths have creepy music following them around, but they also break their facade by quickly adopting a blank expression, and then start explaining their evil plans with a calculated smirk." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1dn3-c_wZE&lc=UgxYtCnt1k5d_0ECduJ4AaABAg
	- Dealing with psychopaths is hard, they viciously destroy us to reach their purposes

		- "Cooking tasty rice required the temperature to be controlled in a specific pattern – high at the beginning, low in between, and high again at the end. Regulating temperature with firewood was not a fun task, and was made worse by the fact that women got called "failed housewives" for not being able to make good rice :|"
		- "Many companies attempted to invent an electric rice cooker. In post-war Japan, as work fixing radios dried up, Masaru Ibuka tried to channel his small company's ingenuity toward building one. After several months of futile attempts, he finally gave up, and his company never tried making rice cookers again. Maybe for a good reason – that company was Sony" => duh, haha
