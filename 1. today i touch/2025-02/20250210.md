	- On Trump's Tariffs policy and why bringing the low surplus "manufacturing" back to the US is a step down of competitiveness, you should have everybody make chips instead of steel or oil manufacturing

		- page 6: "is a competitive nation one with a large positive balance of trade?" ... "The only meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level is productivity. The principal goal of a nation is to produce a high and rising standard of living for its citizens. The ability to do so depends on the productivity with which a nation's labor and capital are employed. Productivity is the value of the output produced by a unit of labor or capital. Productivity depends on both the quality and features of products (...) and the efficiency with which they are produced. Productivity is the prime determinant of a nation's long run standard of living; it is the root cause of national per capita income. The productivity of human resources determines employee wages; the productivity with which capital is employed determines the return it earns for its holders"
		- page 7: "International trade and foreign investment can both improve a nation's productivity as well as threaten it. They support rising national productivity by allowing a nation to specialize in those industries and segments of industries where its companies are more productive and to import where its companies are less productive. **No nation can be competitive in everything**. The ideal is to deploy the nation's limited pool of human and other resources into the most productive uses. Even those nations with the highest standards of living have many industries in which local companies are uncompetitive."
			- This is how the US will go to hell, or playing in its closed league
			- "Yet international trade and foreign investment also can threaten productivity growth. They expose a nation's industries to the test of international standards of productivity. An industry will lose out if its productivity is not sufficiently higher than foreign rivalsâ€™ to offset any advantages in local wage rates. If a nation loses the ability to compete in a range of high-productivity/high-wage industries, its standard of living is threatened"
