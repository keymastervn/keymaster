Knudsen's leadership raised the productive capacity of the US war machine by a 100x in areas like plane production, where it went from producing 3,000 planes in 1939 to over 300,000 by 1945. He was quoted on his achievement: "We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible"."

	- Here are the key points from Bernie Sanders' speech, grouped in approximately 30-second to 1-minute intervals:
		- t=0:08s-t=0:44s The US is an oligarchic society where billionaires dominate politics, media, government, and economic lives. Oligarchs desire more power, control, and wealth, hindering ordinary people and democracy.
		- t=0:58s-t=1:23s Oligarchs view government and laws as obstacles to their interests and entitlements. Modern-day oligarchs resemble kings who believe they possess the absolute right to rule.
		- t=1:23s-t=1:50s Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos possess a combined wealth exceeding $900 billion, surpassing the wealth of the bottom half of American society. Since Trump's election, Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos have become considerably wealthier.
		- t=1:50s-t=2:14s While the very rich accumulate more wealth, a significant portion of Americans face financial struggles.
		- t=2:14s-t=2:42s Oligarchs will sacrifice the well-being of working individuals to safeguard their interests and employ media to divert attention.
		- t=2:42s-t=3:01s Oligarchs allocate substantial funds to buy politicians in both major political parties. The oligarchs are engaging in a war against the working class.
		- t=3:01s-t=3:37s The ruling class fears that Americans will unite to demand a government representing all citizens, not just the wealthy elite. The ruling class will attempt to make people feel powerless to change the system.
		- t=3:37s-t=4:16s Throughout history, numerous endeavors once deemed impossible have been realized through struggle and sacrifice. Despair is not a viable option; people must actively fight back by participating in the political process, establishing new communication channels, and fostering community engagement.
