	- Rule #1: processes should be universally understood
	- Rule #2: processes should protect people
	- Rule #3: when things get tough, people should run towards the process, not away from it
	- Rule #4: processes should be centered around constraints
- People ask me "How can I learn X or Y"? I tell them, why not learning how to learn first, the **meta learning**. And they are confused which seems right, who can truly understand education without knowing liberal arts first?
	- There are two major components in your learning process. The first one is "Topic" and the second one is "Feedback". You can go through many "Topic" like I have been doing, but it won't be learnt until having "Feedback"
	- In school where we earn the easiest, most popular form of education is "curated common Topic" and getting tests/exams for scores, which is "curated Feedback". It is made to help us get ready into life, not a form of true education that is made to break its own "curated" thing. 
		- True education means a lost soul, you are not only self-transform the Feedback into your inner feeling, not a given score or a desire of being higher than others. Make it pure. But also, you are breaking the Topic into free topic.
		- What do you get from this? Well, when the time is up and learning something else is vital, you win. Not only that, we can learn anything in life perpetually and effortlessly
	- "Topic" and "Feedback" are actually concepts of "Observability", I want-you-to-start-noticing-everything-around-you-with-purposes.
		- The more you watch, the more you learn
	- And who can truly understand liberal arts without understanding education haha. You are cursed to be confused, like me, until certain fortitude.
	- What do you want from education? Freedom or Power?
		- True science is something needs to be cited and started from current knowledge. Do you need to embody science in your learning process?
		- IF you focus on yourself, just go, you'll be. You'll know much about yourself. IF you follow others, just go, you'll be more than you are, you can teach others and are respected. 
			- Nothing is wrong, I only focus on myself, I possess knowledge about myself, I know dark and grey things but it is all about myself. I don't want to talk more than myself-related.
