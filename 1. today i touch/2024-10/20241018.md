	- "Flow-ers seem to be almost beyond experiencing emotions, probably due to the absence of self-awareness…” But self-awareness is not a precondition for the _experience_ of emotions, only the _recognition_ and _labeling_ of them. This is why non-human mammals who lack a sense of self are nevertheless capable of experiencing emotions"
		- The final state of self-awareness is "denial". I have to quote because I don't know if saying it "denial" or "effortless" would be more proper. Just feel like if we are aware of too many things at ease, we are simply _unaware_ of all things. The awareness then becomes the next level of context understanding as all elements are acknowledged and simplified (calculated). We are distracted by a car accident when sitting in Cafe, it is because we don't acknowledge that accidents happens eventually, and we are more inclined to awareness more than taking action. Don't be surprised, but let's take action when you feel necessary.

- https://archive.is/UZZit you can't simply compare WordPress's popularity with Rails and say you win, Matt. Yours was in the very early day of weblog and geocities, you simplified many things, reached many low-tech people and good things, promoted buyable plugins and themes. You also get it wrong by saying DHH didn't possess the ability to scale team. Agree he is toxic and biased, but he got sharp points. People hated him, he is a bullshit core maintainer from Rails 6, but is gaining plausible features in Rails 8.
