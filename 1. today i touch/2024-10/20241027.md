	- It is not only about the qualifications of the viewers have improved but also the decline of makers in storytelling ability
		- It is a very huge gap that any bullshit movies will be rejected. It has to be art in many ways.
		- Some deputy minister said that Vietnamese reading culture is lost. I don't think so. There are many movies/books club/page who have been delivering very curated points of view of true art. That in one hand improving the skills of viewer a lot, but in another hand, denies the effort of the movie makers.
		- Making movies is hard, you can't make deep narrative ones with complex structure as viewers won't comprehend, they won't come to the cinema. But if you make cheap, you are dead. And the definition of cheap is consistently moving up to the next level. Think, think harder.
