	- "However, the principle of democracy, taken in the abstract, is open to different and competing interpretations. In political practice, the identity of the ruling will with the will of the people is never a simple given. Rather, it is always the result of an act of identification"
	- "Schmitt acknowledges this problem in his _Constitutional Theory_"...... "Every citizen, therefore, should participate on equal terms, as far as practically feasible, in the exercise of political rule"
	- "The creation of a democratic constitution must not be thought of along the lines of a social contract"
	- Leadership starts from empathy. When a man with a hungry stomach stops sitting down and tell his hungry men to start on something with him.
	- Multi-lateral thinking is based on knowing concepts. If you are not knowing enough and not having time enough to think, you will be simple-minded.
		- Just realize that the AI is very good at understanding politics and philosophy due to knowing concepts.
	- Democracy at a large scale is challenging because of the public's lack of political engagement in general or the manipulation by a small, powerful minority. The bigger it is, politics is more spreading out unevenly to the vacuums of power of smaller parts of it. 
		- To control public's politics is to control public's granularity aka "community". And the foundations of "International Order" as rules.
	- "This containment of war, Schmitt claims, was premised on the willingness to bracket the question of justice on the level of ius ad bellum. Once one takes the view that a war can be legitimate on one side, while being illegitimate on the other, one is forced to conclude, Schmitt argues, that it is morally wrong to grant the status of legitimate belligerency to those who are judged to fight without a just cause, and equally wrong to assume that they ought to enjoy the same in bello-rights as those who fight justly (NE 320–2; CP 54–7)"

	- "Be careful with sorbet. It's easy so assume it's just an upgrade, but it can stifle productivity and developer energy. Very few companies adopted it, and not because they were lazy, but because the language that you end up with is kinda a sad in-between language."
- https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/blob/main/Gemfile the first thing I always do when taking a look at any Rails/Ruby repo is the Gemfile, is there something I don't know?
	- https://github.com/hooopo/second_level_cache write-through and read-through cache
		- Read-Through: Queries by ID, like `current_user.articles.find(params[:id])`, will first look in cache store and then look in the database for the results of that query. If there is a cache miss, it will populate the cache.
		- Write-Through: As objects are created, updated, and deleted, all of the caches are automatically kept up-to-date and coherent.

	- "And at one of those conferences, sometime in 2016, Evan just sort of grabbed Richard and me in the hallway and said, “Do you guys want to maintain Puma?” And we were like, “yeah, sure.” So we did"
		- Yep
	- "The only reason HTTP/2 would be useful in Puma would be slightly better development performance."
