	- _Discipline and Punish_, published in 1975: "“to punish less, perhaps; but certainly to punish better"
		- "At the core of Foucault’s picture of modern disciplinary society are three primary techniques of control: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgment, and the examination. To a great extent, control over people (power) can be achieved merely by observing them"
		- "On Foucault’s account, the relation of power and knowledge is far closer than in the familiar Baconian engineering model, for which “knowledge is power” means that knowledge is an instrument of power, although the two exist quite independently. Foucault’s point is rather that, at least for the study of human beings, the goals of power and the goals of knowledge cannot be separated: in knowing we control and in controlling we know"

		- "In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in [German idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism "German idealism") and progressed closer to [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism "Pragmatism")" -> new homework
