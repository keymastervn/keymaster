	- "librdkafka supports the idempotent producer which provides strict ordering and and exactly-once producer guarantees. The idempotent producer is enabled by setting the `enable.idempotence` configuration property to `true`, this will automatically adjust a number of other configuration properties to adhere to the idempotency requirements, see the documentation of `enable.idempotence` in [CONFIGURATION.md](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/7.5/clients/librdkafka/html/md_CONFIGURATION.html) for more information. Producer instantiation will fail if the user supplied an incompatible value for any of the automatically adjusted properties, e.g., it is an error to explicitly set `acks=1` when `enable.idempotence=true` is set."
