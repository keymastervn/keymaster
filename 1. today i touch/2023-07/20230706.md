	- "at the same time, I think the problem a lot of entrepreneurs have is that they overfocus on "what you are interested in" instead of "what the market wants"" -> so true
	- loving something is like fuel, you are solving a business problem. One hand - self-motivation, the other hand - key result.

	- always think about: how many stuff we have to care about when importing stuff related to MDM? -> number of concerns = interfaces.
	- a builder: handler having next_handler as a sequence. Nice.
		- Good point: having before_handler and after_handler callback because the call interface is simple
		- Bad point: abstraction must have nothing relevant to each other. You can't build roof without knowing how much weight the foundation supports, you end up passing states across handlers
			- But OOP is built to solve this problem so it fits to the context, and it is concrete not generic.
			- But he made the handler interface to be consistent: right now `entity`, `mdm_info`

	- Repository pattern has always been underestimated. A formal way to manage connections across DB.
	- Not sure about the gloried importer. How is it right now?
- Two things, in my opinion, quickly destroy people: being alone and not having enough money
	- Interestingly, whether we have a lot of money or little money, our loneliness is amplified.

- Given a set of elements `[A,B,C,D,E,F]` you want to make sure a unique presentation eg. unique title
	- Like, `A.title` is "lorem ipsum", if `B.title` is also "lorem ipsum" then append `B.title` + `B.another_attributes` eg. "lorem ipsum at New York"
		- But still I want to keep it heuristic like C "lorem ipsum at down town New York" when C is presented similarly to B
	- It'd be a builder to set this unique presentation logic.
		- So I guess there should be a matrix
			- A - B - C - D - E - F
			- B 
			- C
			- D
			- E
			- F
		- If there are matching attributes, mark them as 1, find a way to connect "unmatches" aka 0. Similar to the count island problem, but it has to connect a line of 0 from left to right or topdown, AND for every value we choose, it becomes 1, eg A-C === C-A === 1
			- -  A - B - C - D - E - F
			- A  -   1 
			- B  1    -            1     1
			- C              -
			- D       1            -
			- E        1                   -   1
			- F                            1    -
		- Always approach this with dynamic programming
			- am I get wrong? It should be determined by attributes not element?
		- Feel like sudoku
