- Should I spend money for postman? The good thing is - it has web UI, is convenient like ngrok, but I can only spend 3$ for each of them monthly, i don't feel 12$ per *user* monthly affordable because I just want this line "- Unlimited collaboration for plan members". The most fitting stuff is Github Pro, which is about 3-4$ monthly, and my motivation for Github is previously to keep it alive and sustainable :lol:
	- But it survives now I think, under the umbrella of Microsoft who is *no longer* evil.
	- Using Github has a joy feeling, the octocat exposes a friendly feeling.
	- I would try persisting the APIs in the workspace to a Github repo, so everyone in the team can pull and use, instead of paying 12$ for each user. Maybe, money makes buyer smart. ![[Screenshot 2023-07-15 at 13.27.32.png]]
- long time no see the manager playbook https://github.com/keymastervn/managers-playbook, it is mostly (if not totally) about communication

	- Short sentences create a punctuation feeling. Ideally, it has to create a sieve combining short and long sentences focusing on a rhythm. Somehow, the rhythm can be rock, or jazzy, or ballad depends on the message you want to deliver.

	- "For staff meetings, go around the table and ask reports what their biggest concerns are.", I believe so, just ask your closest panel ie. EM, PO what is your concern?
		- Having visibility demands makes a mess.
	- One of my favourite topics is **communication** basics. I think most people don't get it, they focus on English which is just vocabulary and grammar. Communication is something higher than that in term of delivering messages. For writing basics,
		- The last sentence creates the sentiment for the whole paragraph. Eg. `I go running, and it rains` VS `it rains and I go running`
		- Also, repeated sentences create stress, so use your commas wisely.
			- Stress is good to keep something in the reader's mind. But overloaded stress makes him forget.
			- Learn Hemingway writing style for ELI5
		- Positive sentiment is created due to a formula where the last sentence is more positive than the previous one. Eg. `. means negative, - means neutral, / means positive`
			- `. /`
			- `. - /`
			- `. . -`
			- `- - /`
			- Don't repeat positivities, it is "toxic positivity" bro, let's prune it eg. `/ / /` => `/`, or `. / /` => `. /`. In the above examples, I didn't make the 2 last sentences positive.
		- Keep it short like Hemingway, keep it in a structure so previous readers understand your writing style. At first it takes them 10 minutes to read your documents, then it will be only 1 minute.
		- Visualisation tools, hundreds of them out there, it is a skill.
	- Also focus on lossy or lossless verbal communication. If I speak slowly, I can guarantee my pronunciation is good enough. If not, I rather focus on speaking fast, accept a form of [lossy], but rich in information given per second. Believing that people accept this unprofessional English speaking skill as I am not a native speaker hehe.
		- Be committed when speaking, like call to action speaking and timely verify the listener if they actually get the idea. Words are the source of misunderstandings - Le Petit Prince.
			- Don't ask me how to verify. It is simple like: I think you understand what I've said. Don't make it negative like "do you understand what I've said?", it is disrespect.
			- Using known concepts, idioms OR analogies is great. F\*ck, it is the essence, the art of communication.
		- Know your audiences
- I may unlearn all philosophy stuff as well as communication one, soon.
