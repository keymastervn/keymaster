- When reading a book, what is your process
	- Consuming from the first page to the last page, unlearn relearn/take note or whatever to keep you remember the content
	- Comprehending the overview, context layout, key takeaways and concepts, you may start at random page and stop at another random page, tends to forget, but you have a picture on what you are reading and where it is
		- Your understanding of the concepts might be different from what the author wrote on the book
		- Your mapping could be wrong, but it is yours, you are still knowledgable
- Back to the problem related to sharing the transaction between DBs eg. pg AND Redis
	- https://redis.io/docs/interact/transactions/ vs https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-savepoint.html
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-09 at 10.24.04.png]]
	- But unlike PostgreSQL [Redis does not support rollbacks of transactions](https://redis.io/docs/interact/transactions/#:~:text=queued%20at%20all.-,What%20about%20rollbacks%3F,-Redis%20does%20not)
		- DOES IT MEAN WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRASHPOINT AND GENERATE "down COMMAND" to MANUALLY ROLLBACK INSTEAD?
		- In the context of CDC, it is feasible right? Because that redis command is atomic so writing a callback command is easy.

- https://redis.io/docs/manual/pipelining/#redis-pipelining
	- "For instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server."
	- "Pipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the round trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations you can perform per second in a given Redis server. This is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from the point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply, but it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This involves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user land to kernel land. The context switch is a huge speed penalty."

	- Nietzsche said "God is dead" to make people stop believing in the causal law but thyself
	- Feuerbach said "God is no one but you" to make yourself a temple for everything happened so you don't have to seek for havens. We create God in our own image, and that we project onto God all of the qualities that we admire and desire.
	- Carl Jung psychologically said that "your painfully denials creates shadow", a powerful being but feeling hopeless and is placed like clothes in your wardrobe. As being denied at the beginning context now getting more and more denials from your feeling (heart) and thinking (mind), it becomes even darker and more evils.
	- I connect Carl Jung's shadow and Feuerbach's reflection. I think God is an image of ourselves, an opposite identity to our existing shadows but it has different power, our acceptance (or hope) is gathered into that image. It is desperate, not able to listen, holy, warm and stupid.
		- One who has never entered a denial state won't ever think about God. God always start from a stomach (or hunger, thanks Feuerbach), like our dogs think that we-human are their god; then upscaling to our zone of awareness, the more we feel, the more pain we get. The more people try answering who God are, the more helpless they are leading to the more "God" concept is concrete.
			- One different point between thinkers and believers, is the inheritance of the Stupid flowing to the mind of believer people. They are manipulated by organisations of Stupid.
	- So if there are heaven and hell, I will choose going to whatever, in the context of the anime Death Parade. I believe hell is not different from heaven, and hell or heaven only matters because it depends on what someone felt when living on earth. Hell is mostly described by pains, but it is perhaps just physical pains; Heaven stills have pains, perhaps the pains won't start from a hunger but at least a ladder of levels (if not then why in Christian, Lucifer as an **arch**angel turned to an archevil)
		- Ironically when we are all living happily on earth, some organisations of Stupid create another concept: future Apocalypse
	- Marx said "con người là tổng hòa của những mối quan hệ xã hội" whereas God is perhaps just a relationship :v

	- Repository Pattern, `repository.save Article.new(title: 'Test')` and callback supported
	- What is the simplest way to organise indexing? I hate the way that we have to add additional thing to the existing stack for development. Preferably, https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot seems to be more [convenient](https://gist.github.com/maxivak/e1211b67d33add72a4c4#run-solr-in-development)
		- But it can always be like mobile development: start a ElasticSearch docker instance.
