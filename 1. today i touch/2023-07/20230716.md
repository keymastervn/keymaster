	- How to do view someone as potential?
		- Why [Griffith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_(Berserk)) chose Guts in 3 seconds?
			- He can swing his giant sword, he is spotless, his words are clear, his will is pure?
		- Every time you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks at you. On how you view other people is actually the how you are viewing yourself.
		- I think that potential person must be a "unlocked" one. When I look deeply into those eyes, I can see how potential they are, including the way they talk and the helpless their soul is. It is listened by a different language. Observation is never enough for human.
			- But a potential can be a potential bad guy, his/her goals are manipulated by the lack of worldview, maybe greedy.

	- "On July 6, 2023, weÂ [announced](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability)Â the deprecation of ada, babbage, curie and davinci models. These models, including fine-tuned versions, will be turned off on January 4, 2024. We are actively working on enabling fine-tuning for upgraded base GPT-3 models as well as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4, we recommend waiting for those new options to be available rather than fine-tuning based off of the soon to be deprecated models."
	- Dafuq, it's legacy now ðŸ¤·, how can I afford your pricey GPT 3.5 model? If it aligns to the davinci one, `Train: $0.0300 / 1K tokens || Usage: $0.1200 / 1K tokens` :omg:
