	- "And so long as men die, liberty will never perish"
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_You by Lev Tolstoy
		- Book, [HTML](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/43302/pg43302-images.html). This is written post-Feuerbach era. 
		- this [one](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/43302/pg43302-images.html#Page_184) inspired Gandhi, as Tolstoy's book "overwhelmed" him, and "left an abiding impression"
			- I don't like Gandhi's passive resistance. But it worked and his Indian people got freedom. What i don't like is that form of freedom is maintaining one of the worst social infrastructure. 
- [Leadership] "An army of sheep led by a lion is better than an army of lions led by a sheep." *by* Alexander the Great
	- No better, both are failed armies. Given a real-world context, not all sheep are obedient enough to be led by a Lion, even more, sheep are really psychological-friendly and culture fit with the sheep lead.
		- Sheep have their own dynamics will dethrone and disobey the Lion, in a "democracy" way :D
	- I think a better leadership analogy is a wolfpack.
		- Two wolves as pack lead, one first and one last. The last can be an old one, his claws are blunt but his eyes are not, and his knowledge is the most valuable thing he can contribute to the pack.
		- Definitely, duo-leadership may be conflicted sometimes, but in a long history of humanity and civilization, we **have been working this way**. It is a classic approach towards leadership.
			- Benevolent dictatorship concept will be discussed later
