	- "Right before going into battle, my grandfather’s Army commander briefed them on the operation. He told them that it was going to be a tough, bloody fight, and they were outnumbered FIVE to ONE! About an hour into the battle, my grandfathers commander saw him leaning against a tree, smoking a cigarette. His commander asked him “There’s a battle going on. What are the hell are you doing, here?” My grandfather looked at him and said “I got my five."
	- In distress, the message that Putin actually delivers: "I am allowing you to suffer", distress as it costs lives of both sides. If it was 3-5/1 then for each 50K UA men, there are 10K men down his side. Retrospecting deeply, again, wars ain't fun.
- https://thanhvy.gitlab.io/blog/awesome-books-about-adult-development/ Vy is an ex-Reapra (in fact, she was a head scientist). She is a knowledgable person, only Vy who dares to say COVID-19 is not a black swan; I guess, her feeling of me is more like towards a cold steel haha. This is her curate list of books related to adult development theories
	- I still don't have enough time to talk about Reapra, this is authentically written here https://book.reapra.com/
		- [URL](https://book.reapra.com/03-chapter3.html#3-3%EF%BC%9A%E6%88%90%E4%BA%BA%E7%99%BA%E9%81%94%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96%E5%B0%8E%E5%85%A5): "Reapra has supported self-transformation of entrepreneurs by referring to the Adult Development Theory (ADT), which is a part of developmental psychology"
		- Still, it mentions ["Teal Organization"](https://www.iberdrola.com/talent/teal-organisations), and the [Ego development theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loevinger%27s_stages_of_ego_development#Possible_Tenth_Stage:_Flowing_(E10))
			- In term of E10, I (might) have been entering "the Flow" smoothly, but the "no more holding" is very idealistic. I maybe somewhat around E9, depending on the safe zone I feel around me.
			- "Teal Organisation" is the point on which I critically focus on self-management style. Some managers may feel uncomfortable when sharing their pieces of work BUT not me. However, it needs a really solid foundation.
