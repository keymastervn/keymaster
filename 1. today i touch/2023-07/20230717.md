	- "Networked multiplayer games are incredibly fun, but introduce a whole new class of challenges. The authoritative server architecture is pretty good at stopping most cheats, but a straightforward implementation may make games quite unresponsive to the player. In the following articles, weâ€™ll explore how can we build a system based on an authoritative server, while minimizing the delay experienced by the players, to the point of making it almost indistinguishable from local or single player games."
	- At least, in the design we are NOT assuming unlimited resources and network bandwidth like web microservices running in synchronous paradigm ðŸ™‚. In certain game scenarios, one simple word [unplayable](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html#:~:text=case%2C%20be%20completely-,unplayable,-.%20In%20this%20article).
	- server 128-tick [explained](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/entity-interpolation.html#server-time-step), so a FPS server receives a queue of action from client-side and batch processing at a more frequent - predictable rate. 100ms server = 10-tick => 128-tick server = 7.8125ms. If you are late at 8ms, your next actions will have to wait for another 8ms.
		- the server will reconcile, but in a hacking manner, can you cheat like: all of your headshot actions are made at the 108.1ms (very beginning of the next batch), instead of 101ms (100+8+ 3ms - middle of next batch). So your headshot is faster than your opponent's headshot thus the server always recognises your dead reckoning. It is possible due to in client-side, you can always manipulate your action queue, you are simply in a very high priority.
			- In a world where bot vs. bot like stock trading, cheating this frequency gives you a significant advantage. Don't underestimate 1ms as I heard stories such as moving to closer place near the trading server for that.
				- However, don't believe me, that action queue for high frequency trading IS server-side ðŸ™‚. Whoever makes it locally must be thrown to trashcan.
	- This one can be used to teach game mechanics in university. At my time, no such thing was lectured.
