- Let's talk about Dota 2
	- It is a game of two sides, each side having 5 players with the definition of win is to destroy the opponent's throne. The game is working on a square-shaped map where the thrones (as the primary objective) are set in two corners (top-east, bottom-west) and are the home of two sides: Dire and Radiant.
		- The map has three lanes, which is set by the movement of creeps. Creeps is the main source of gold, the game currency, besides a second-rate gold given mechanism which is made to balance the game.
		- Not only having the thrones, there are sub-objectives placed around the map, like runes and neutral creep camps, high-grounds for visions AND a big creep named Roshan which leverage the chance to win the game.
	- update change, micro change. but some people feel afraid because they are very focused on game execution, not how to win in a big picture.
		- they feel hurt, because of the erosion in their knowledge. If they focus on learning, meta-learning (learning how to learn), they won't feel it, in contrast, they will enter a race to find optimal tricks related to a new design.
