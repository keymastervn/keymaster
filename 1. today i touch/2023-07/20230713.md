	- "Ông chủ yếu ở nước ngoài, nghiên cứu về cách làm nông nghiệp" -> behind every tech collapse is a good thing.
- Sometimes you want something intensely, but in a tic tac you falter and hold yourself back. Do you feel that dark motivation?
	- You really want to win but on the other hand, a belief rises, blocking your will in an ambiguous way
	- Your consciousness vs. subconsciousness. It is a fight between you and your shadow, you want a cake, but your shadow prevents you from having that cake without a clear reason. The shadow knows it is perhaps dangerous that way, or the prize isn't worth. Most of the time, both of you are right, or the shadow is more rightful than you, but the shadow is silent and you are torn apart.
		- Yes, it is sometimes called the six sense. But to me, the six sense is a more complex concept, it has more dimensions.
	- How to defend yourself to keep moving on your track? Given the context that your shadow is still non-communicable.
		- non-communicable: you are yet to know how to talk to that entity.

		- most Tiki devs if not dumb usually work on two jobs at once
			- I don't mean bad for devs, actually there are competent devs at Tiki, but the situation is very, very bad.
		- Tiki warehouse workers abuse the process on their clients' source of goods to even detain/mark an order as lost.
			- Seem like for central logistics, it is easy to make equivalent items replaceable across business partners for auto fulfillment
		- The problem of Tiki is not due to scaling to fast, but the curse given by investment metrics, it makes the business lost its core for chasing unicorns. If they couldn't earn more profit, cost-saving is incontestable. They Tiki doesn't understand Tiết Kiệm.
