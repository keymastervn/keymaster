- Trust people, people > process. There will never be a small process to ask you to do something in a micro context, as processes need-to-be-consumed by people, then people will be overloaded by these kinds of process. You can create processes for machine which is what i am actually doing: programming, BUT processes for human should be bound to happened errors to make people do better and even better definition if a process has its context.
	- It is like, laws need to be simplified, if the context is no longer valid. It's a sort of garbage collection in term of machine. 
	- No matter how ideal your wife is - maybe good parent, good job, good education, good network. If she is good, she is good, if she has a good deed, she will be good.
	- Know how a process is made for and its GRANULARITY.
