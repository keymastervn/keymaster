- Teacher is the hardest job and also the easiest job
	- easiest because most of teacher tasks such as transfer knowledge to student by a fix curriculum can be done easily, also testing/auditing/monitoring progress can be supported by machine
	- hardest because equipping attitude and mindset doesn't look easy as they are hidden and you have to look deeply into a person to diagnose. A surgeon doctor need to study at least 7 years to eligibly practice on a fix human body, but a true teacher can't just take some psychology courses and trying to fix one's mind (they are not thinking it at the first place)
		- fix: which has been changing slowly by thousands of years

	- I feel my shoes are hermit. But if you know me long enough, you may know I killed my ego desperately so I am no love,hate,angry,disappointed anymore. And I don't want to be irreplacible. 
	- this 4 parts series is RR, this is how a senior is made in any fields

- I am going to drop citibank cc,  because one of my friend are using their CC as free of charge. I don't think I can't live without cc, ewallet like momo takes nothing from me while providing many good stuff
	- I pay 1320k annually, monthly usage 6-8m, but yearly cashback is just 800k, hmmm
	- for eg. lazada voucher, I have to compete with other citibank users to make use of the voucher, "it's wtf moment" for a 30s
	- for luxury services discount, actually, if using, I am spending luxury priviledge that is too much over the discount
	- for abroad payment, the exchange fee is damn highest atm.
	- change my mind? the credit line scoring? really stupid
