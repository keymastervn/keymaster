		- well, at first they tried iframe like EH, when they bought TicketBox
			- but they double login instead of shadow-syncing :hmm:, and they blame bad UX
				- but consistency is secured :D only token exchanges
		- then, they inject Ticketbox into Tiki, good: they are fucking React, react-native
			- make me think: why KP is not a mobile app
			- and face the problem of bundle size
			- and with zero isolation -> bad compiling leads to app crash

				- you open the superapp, which is a "shell" at its purist, search for the service Bike
				- or you scan the QR code => you unlock the feature
					- it downloads the app content through CDN
				- you are authenticated,  you have credit and stuff needed for using the service
				- you can end the session, upon arrival
				- COOL, nice UX, stuff like appstore are troublesome because it has no motivation to leverage this practice, in contrast it aims to magnetize the user money upfront
					- a conflict of interest is there: developer vs platform
					- this is very open, as HTML and web standards are truly open
