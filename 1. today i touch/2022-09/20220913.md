- Normalized diamond hands by purging bad apple players, ask diamond hands get strength by quatitive + propaganda for setting up a ladder psychological baseline rather than scale
- https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-uml-really-died/
	- "OOSE, OOAD, and OMT were holistic methods, covering both notation and process"
	- "UML-as-sketching didn’t so much die as _drift_" and "UML-as-programming died in infancy" `.` with "UML-as-blueprint integrated the different diagram types"
	- Me: They should be dead, except for some still useful [behavioral diagrams](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/uml-diagram-types-examples/) eg. sequence or state diagram.
		- Tooo much effort if an architect has to follow a strict design principle by UML, product-led user stories just display enough context for a small proposal + strategy decision
