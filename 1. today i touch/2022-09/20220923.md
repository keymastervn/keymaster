- I love coding, fucking love it, code 30000 days until I can't. I am willing to do it more than anyone, I want it to be perfect more than anyone, also I want to read more code than anyone, want to get more coding knowledge than anyone and every-single-thing related to it. Though I has been in a great mentality fortitude on my journey of growing up that I can't explicitly show or say about this love, I want to at least tell about the root cause of everything written here, a bonfire of dream, me and the dream.
