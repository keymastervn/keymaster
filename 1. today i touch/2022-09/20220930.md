- Someone has to take a look at the services folder and merge the concern + update codeowner to make it looks like resource-based.
- When removing data X: assume that X belongs to service A, X also has distributed association Y from service B so we need to access B to remove Y. The technical choice is using `kafka` bus as the actor is Admin. So we will make a bus like `A.X.Delete` with X.uuid sent alongside. So here is the concern :thinking:
	- Should the invoke service execute the code at the time it is called (only B need to handle the bus), or
	- it would just send the payload to the bus and there will be handler also at service A.
	- Cons: wtf, why you make things complicated?
	- Pros: service agnostic, treating A and B equally even when X belongs to A. Because who knows there is a migration for moving X to B locally?

	- smell like notion + gdocs with "Knowledge Network" and trello/asana for task management with a pull request concept for approval workflow, can't fix the documentation for code

- Teaching babies nowadays is quite easy, you don't need an expert or reading so many parental books. When the baby lies, you can google how to treat it well and get the answer, when the baby scream loudly, you can do it too.
	- But the true problem is you want to hear shit more than pure knowledge, you want to do tricks more than getting a well-explained way of how can it be.
