	- Before Flow, you have to understand "boundary concept" well as prerequisite, it is hard to understand. You have to read a lot of stories, you have to understand how people punch others, how a country has border line, what is privacy, explicity and implicity. It is all about contexts.
	- But it can be wrong, with Flow you want to evolve yourself to solve problems more than happiness. Flow is the state of anti "v√¥ minh" which is just a part of happiness in Buddism.

	- Mark my words: any meritocracy system is built for the ugly good and ugly bad, not for those who is purely good.

They ugliers want to cheat the system as much as they can as they are damn greedy, so let's hope they are greedy good and promote the "equal shares for everyone" egalitarianism a little.
