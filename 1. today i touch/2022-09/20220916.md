	- while mperham want rails to extract its Convention over Configuration into a gem
		- yup, actually in any gem, we have to manually load it (if not using zeitwerk)
	- Searls wants to deny OOP aspect of rails, mentioning that "model" and "controller" should be configuration `object`  instead of having "feature behavior", makes sense a bit :thinking:
		- So do you dare do NO CODE controller get/post/destroy... and NO CODE model?
