	- "Iâ€™m in the US and have held most jobs (Developer, Lead, Manager) but try to stay a Developer and get pushed into the other jobs. And I teach Programming and Data Structures at the local Community College one night a week. Out of a typical class there are maybe 3 or 4 who should pursue being a Programmer, the rest are varying degrees of frightening. Unfortunately, academia is not interested in capability, they are interested (just like any bureaucracy) in perpetuating itself by showing success, with success being defined by finished courses. Note that is finished, not accomplished, succeeded, or met a standard."
