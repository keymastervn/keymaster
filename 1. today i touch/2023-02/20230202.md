	- org_logo after being duplicated/persisted to another services, is there a way without sync, or without client-side fetching? Given 
		- the data (org_logo) is rarely change, but the data (notifications/events) in that service is huge reference (ie. 10000 records)
		- the service is dead-end, no grpc to fetch will be approved
		- the resources (org) is not the concern of the service so syncing is hmm.

	- "Over the years, we’ve improved TAO’s cache consistency by one measure, from 99.9999 percent (six nines) to 99.99999999 percent (10 nines)" wow
	- **A mental model of cache invalidation**
	- “x=4 @version 4,” SO here create a key=value caching that
		- key can not be invalidated, but is versioned (cost: storage)
		- cache expiry is doubled is older version, up to a max_expiry
		- applicable only when the cost of refreshing stale data is huge that can't be done soon and the use of stale data is acceptable (high availability over consistency)
