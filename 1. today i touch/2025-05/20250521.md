	- "I was a bit surprised by how skeptical Chip Huyen and swyx were about A2A. They really schooled me on the notion that the future of agents is in direct AI-to-AI interactions....... But swyx and Chip weren’t buying it, at least not now. They think that’s a long way off, given the current state of AI engineering. I was glad to have them bring me back to earth."
	- "If you think we’re close to AGI, try building an agent, and you’ll see how far we are from AGI."
	- "We still need code that is simple and modular—that’s easier for LLMs to understand, as well as humans. We still need good feedback loops that show us whether code is working (echoing Harper). We still need logical, analytical, critical thinking about problem solving. At the end, she summarized both poles of the conference, saying we need cultures that reward both experimentation and skepticism" -> yep.
	- "In this regard, I was struck by Camille Fournier’s assertion that managers love to see their senior developers using AI tools, because they have the skills and judgment to get the most out of it, but often want to take it away from junior developers who can use it too uncritically. Addy Osmani expressed the concern that basic skills (“muscle memory”) would degrade, both for junior and senior software developers. (Juniors may never develop those skills in the first place.) Addy’s comment was echoed by many others. Whatever the future of computing holds, we still need to know how to analyze a problem, how to think about data and data structures, how to design, and how to debug."
	- "Almost all of the speakers talked about the importance of up-front design when programming with AI. Harper Reed said that this sounds like a return to waterfall, except that the cycle is so fast. Clay Shirky [once observed](https://pahlkadot.medium.com/dear-governor-elect-72e2f5e3bfdb) that waterfall development “amounts to a pledge by all parties not to learn anything while doing the actual work,” and that failure to learn while doing has hampered countless projects. But if AI codegen is waterfall with a fast learning cycle, that’s a very different model. So this is an important thread to pull on."

	- Bloom, when first proposing his mastery learning strategy in 1968, was convinced that most students can attain a high level of learning capability if the following conditions are available:
		- instruction is approached sensitively and systematically
		- students are helped when and where they have learning difficulties
		- students are given sufficient time to achieve mastery
		- there is some clear criterion of what constitutes mastery
	- In 2012, [Jonathan Bergmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Bergmann "Jonathan Bergmann") and Aaron Sams published the book Flip Your Classroom, Reach Every Student in Every Class Every Day.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning#cite_note-44) The second half of the book was dedicated to how to implement what they called the Flipped-Mastery Model. They merged mastery learning with flipped learning and saw significant results. The book has spurred many teachers across the world to adopt the Flipped-Mastery approach. Bergmann and Sams show that the logistical problems associated with setting up a mastery learning program are now solved by technology. If teachers have to deliver direct instruction, this can be time-shifted with either an instructional video or a flipped-reading assignment. The issue of multiple assessments is also solved by programs that allow for testing to be much more seamless and less burdensome. [Jonathan Bergmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Bergmann "Jonathan Bergmann") extended Mastery Learning in the publication of [[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning#cite_note-45) (ASCD, 2023).

		- "Though Bloom concluded that one-to-one tutoring is "too costly for most societies to bear on a large scale", Bloom conjectured that a combination of two or three altered variables may result in a similar performance improvement. Bloom thus challenged researchers and teachers to "find methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring""
			- every student should have a tutor. Now, it is an AI, a cheap variant of knowledge-only tutor. But it is still dangerous, parents are somehow less dangerous and is more lateral.

	- "Additional note: successful multi agent orchestration is harder than you think. Frameworks that lock in control flow often miss decision points, get stuck in loops, go down rabbit holes that can’t continue. Frameworks that don’t regulate flow, but focus on robust conversation management/handoff management often terminate prematurely, don’t complete, or meander inefficiently. Master single agents first, do your own manual handoff between agents so you can control flow and data handoffs, so that you understand what is likely to happen, before trying a multi-agent ecosystem"
