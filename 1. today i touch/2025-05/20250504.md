		- "Unlike traditional simulations, the advent of internet-native, decentralized agent protocols makes it increasingly feasible to observe and analyze 28 these dynamics at web scale. In the long run, such findings may inform the principled design of distributed agent collectives as a new computational substrate—scalable, adaptive, and capable of exhibiting intelligence beyond individual capabilities." -> is evolving to create a suitable cloth for all agents protocols.

		- Emotions are a key part of how humans think, make decisions, and interact with others. They guide us to understand situations, make choices, and build relationships. Antonio Damasio, in his book Descartes’ Error [25], explained that emotions are not separate from logic. Instead, they are deeply connected to how we reason and act. When developing LLM agents, adding emotional capabilities can potentially make these systems smarter, more adaptable, and better understand the world around them. For LLM agents, emotions can act as a decision-making tool, much like they do for humans. Emotions help us prioritize tasks, understand risks, and adapt to new challenges. Marvin Minsky, in The Emotion Machine [420], described emotions as a way to adjust our thinking processes, helping us solve problems in a more flexible and creative manner. Similarly, LLM agents with emotion-like features could improve their ability of solving complex problems and making decisions in a more human-style.
