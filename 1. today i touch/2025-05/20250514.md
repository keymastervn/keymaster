		- "Is it apathy or something else? It’s hard to interpret the absence of participation. In [_The AI-Driven Leader: Harnessing AI to Make Faster, Smarter Decisions_](https://www.amazon.com/AI-Driven-Leader-Harnessing-Smarter-Decisions/dp/B0DB8QL3ZK) (an audio book I’m currently listening to), Geoff Woods explains:
			- In my initial plan I’d assumed three things: (1) leaders believe AI is the future; (2) leaders believe their business will adopt it, and (3) leaders are actively pursuing AI adoption. But after conducting over 200 one-on-one interviews with executives, I was stunned by my findings. 100% of them believed AI is the future. 100% believed their business would adopt AI. Less than 5% had done anything to bring AI into their organization. This disconnect became the driving force behind this book.
			- Throughout my interviews I discovered that although executives acknowledged the need to adopt AI eventually, three main obstacles held them back: (1) they were too busy with all the existing demands of the business; (2) they didn’t understand what AI was or how it could help them; (3) no one had shown them the simple path to go from zero to one with AI in a way that would create value for them."
