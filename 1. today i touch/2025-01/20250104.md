	- t=9:14 "how long can I pause, I counted 7 seconds, it seemed like an eternity to me to wait and not say anything, but that is a standard amount of time"
		- Well, Steve Job has an iconic 18 seconds of waiting to answer this hard question https://youtu.be/LUm76QQevPA?si=LFIxOnIdJssfIQ4u&t=29
			- t=0:40 for the most important thing he learned when he was at Apple, the answer is great: "I now take a long-term view on people, when I see something not being done right, my first reaction isn't to go fix it, it's to say we are building the team here, we are going to build great stuff for the next decade not just the next year..."
			- t=1:40 for what is the management style, how to resolve confict
				- iconic as well: 
				- (1) You don't agree but buy into it, because it is sooner or later you are paying somebody to do what they think is right but then you are trying to get them to do what they think isn't right, and sooner or later it's out.
				- (2) differentiate important decisions and ones that we don't have to make, and really important one, we'll work on that until we all agree. That's easy to find people to do things, what's harder is to find people to tell you what should be done, right... only 25 important decisions"
			- He, is not only good at making great product, but also making great teams, it is important for the former... there are stories about toxic working culture and toxic perfectionism, but there were many people loved working with him in fact, and they didn't regret.  
		- another one about Apple's management: it's about NO COMMITTEES at Apple https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f60dheI4ARg, "teamwork depends on trusting the other folks to come through with their parts without watching them all the time".... "yes, we have wonderful arguments -> I wish I did (win all arguments :D), you have to run by ideas not hierarchy, the best ideas have to win otherwise good people don't stay"
		- From great ideas and great products to great execution -> let's watch Sam Altman's execution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfAhV8XFefg
