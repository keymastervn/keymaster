		- "The most impressive people I know care a lot about what people think, even people whose opinions they really shouldn’t value (a surprising numbers of them do something like keeping a folder of screenshots of tweets from haters). But what makes them unusual is that they generally care about other people’s opinions on a very long time horizon—as long as the history books get it right, they take some pride in letting the newspapers get it wrong."
		- To those who overthink: I bet I do overthinking better than you, I deliberately desperately think while keeping a straight face and a mentality of inaction because of many clashes and disruptions happen when I think. But thinking is something I can control, if you can't control your superpower, it is a curse; and when I think, I change.
			- My control -> "It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1] but the latter doesn’t seem to get much attention."
				- Some people (may I included?) possess the ability to cohere most subjects on the table to coherently think about. It is 2^n, not N pipes of thinking, especially in arts and philosophy. These are who truly overthink, many of them get lost until knowing what is enough: exiting at M primitives. Not connecting the dots, enlighting the whole map.
			- Your overthinking: your broken feelings, you can change as well, until you realize that your feelings mostly depend on how you look things.
			- I think that a large proportion of overthinkers are stuck in binary/duality thinking, their type of overthinking forces them to use language to describe problems. They fail to distinguish the multidimensionality of rational perception and try to narrow the problem down to either this or that. If they really use their innate feeling, they will feel that there are many things that cannot be expressed in language, but must be felt.
				- Language has its own problems, and it has its own answer for the problems: perhaps hieroglyphs, analogies. They are more than meanings.
				- AI is something more intelligent than hooman, however, it is cursed to learn from hooman languages and to use hooman languages to communicate with hooman. When there is a true AI breakthrough (it will), AI will start talking with each other through a non-duality language. This is when we have "the last philosophy - becoming the second" because we can't learn what AI says but they can learn what we say.

		- "Callbacks are like salt — a little bit can help the model behave more like itself, but you dont want too much. I only use them as a last resort when it makes more sense to use a callback than not because they solve a problem, instead of merely feeling more convenient."
