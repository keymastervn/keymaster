"let's stop it before it's too late", "I tell this Christian group: let's have a sense of proportion, let's live, you are not going to change the world, maybe you've change individuals ... he's seen the light (laugh), but he's got to live"
	- t=7:34 "we are going through this phase, I think sensible sensitive but firm government will write dispatch, soft government trying to accomodate everybody will lead to big mischief"

	- Yep, it is trained in the shoulder of OpenAI, but is immensely open-sourced more than OpenAI or other models and is far cheaper thanks to that foundation. Some of its breakthrough techniques eg. Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLHA) are made by undergrad PhD.

	- "Here I present a straightforward argument that—while not airtight—indicates that AGI will plausibly **cause human wages to fall below subsistence level**. This argument relies on the concept of diminishing returns, although the full version of the argument requires an understanding of decreasing returns to scale in production."
	- "**These constraints loosely suggest that, once it becomes feasible to deploy AGIs widely, their numbers will grow rapidly, quickly saturating existing physical infrastructure. This rapid expansion of the labor supply could drive down the marginal productivity of human labor, sharply cutting wages in a short period of time.**"
	- It’s crucial to note that I have only analyzed the effects of AGI on human wages, rather than **human welfare** overall
