		- Actually, CircleCI has once experimented AI test-rerun, but it made some false-positive issues that break the spec reliability :ew:
		- It is worth saying the circleCI parallelism is based on the tracking records on analyzing `store-test-results`, so its subsequent runs rely on previous runs to knapsack: unbalance, false-positive is accepted.
			- If relying on previous run as dependency mappings/trees, will it break?
			- If it has changes, how md5/manifestation can help invalidate the mapping
				- source_map?
	- https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap
		- bootsnap writes to `tmp/cache`, it has run on init, and it can detect changes perhaps through [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) then invalidates the cache.

		- "Note: Bootsnap and [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) are orthogonal tools. While Bootsnap speeds up the loading of individual source files, **Spring keeps a copy of a pre-booted Rails process on hand** to completely skip parts of the boot process the next time it's needed. The two tools work well together."
			- "Spring makes extensive use of `Process.fork`, so won't be able to provide a speed up on platforms which don't support forking (Windows, JRuby)." --> https://github.com/rails/spring

			- iseq: Instruction sequence(yarv code)
				- `puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile(code).disasm`
				- how to explain iseq under bootsnap folder, MUST READ
			- how about monkey patching `Kernel.require` to see how it loads?
	- Conditions to trigger a spec
		- spec file changed, better if a context is changed
		- the file is changed
		- the related dependencies has changed
			- input files ==> it makes this seems to be a graph
			- gem
			- (or we have to research all loading mechanisms eg. ActiveSupport::Dependencies, zeitwerk, Kernel.require...)

	- Yup, it is enterprisey, if you are enterprisey it should be similar
