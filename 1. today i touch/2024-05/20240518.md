	- Things that we called Fallacies are basically violations of Logic's fundamental principles. Ironically, people tend to remember Fallacies name more than the backbone principles, which are lesser in amount.
	- [Again as I might have said it somewhere] Through dealing with the relations of concepts, Logic accepts or rejects the relevancy of concepts in `add, depend, equal, intersect, anti, against`; and some concepts eg. Justice are specifically highly polarized into either True or False, you can't find the middle.

	- "I have seen the extremely restrictive off-boarding agreement that contains nondisclosure and non-disparagement provisions former OpenAI employees are subject to. It forbids them, for the rest of their lives, from criticizing their former employer. Even acknowledging that the NDA exists is a violation of it" --> what a freedom

	- "The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell people something surprising about."
		- I think if I can just spoil out something related to Psychology or Philosophy, even when it is super fundamental, people will be awed like touching the fountainhead's freshwater. Maybe I should keep writing film's reviews as an indirect way of provoking curiousity towards pure knowledge.
	- "How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it. Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they call an _edge_ — a convincing story about why in some class of trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about it or way of approaching it."
		- Yes, should only bet when you have more chance to win, and more times to win, and more resources to try.
		- I think we have to find backups for everything. Self-explain your points, if not a fact (you may get it wrong occasionally) they should be scientific
			- Can ask AI, it is super good at finding the truth.
	- "If you do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only place where there's room for variation", to develop and get lost for a while, it is accepted
	- "There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us. But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays teach, and you can't teach people something they already know"

	- "Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted culturally. "Everyone knows," for example, that it can be rewarding to have [kids](https://paulgraham.com/kids.html). But till you have them you don't know precisely what forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never have put into words.", yes, more deliberately
	- "But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly on effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing to get. That pool has no bottom. **How to get more questions? That is the most important question of all**."
