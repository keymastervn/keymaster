		- They wrote the article [How Tokopedia Achieved 1000% Faster iOS Build Time](https://medium.com/tokopedia-engineering/how-tokopedia-achieved-1000-faster-ios-build-time-7664b2d8ae5), where they explain how Bazel sped up their builds. The build duration went from 55 minutes to 10 minutes by using Bazel, and down to 5 minutes with remote caching.
	- Given a scenario that we can fetch CHANGED FILES from a PR/Commit, how to run related unit tests
		- `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD`
		- How to clarify the dependency group in relation to eg. model User ![[Pasted image 20240525185245.png]]
		- if `user.rb` changed, we should run that file + fileA,fileB,fileC as affected callers
		- Should it be a manifest? ❌ --> To me, it requires effort to maintain, and it is prone to human errors that breaks the absolute reliability of CIs
		- If using machine/code to guarantee/check this manifest, would be it an indirect way toward this problem? There will be two concerns (1) Why not direct calculate dependency groups? and (2) is it inclined to false-positive?
			- But if there is a machine way, it should be preferred, no brainer
		- should come back later

	- "I appreciate this. I'm a correctional psychologist and I have been told a whole bunch of utterly ridiculous things by inmates that turned out to true. I've also been told lots of lies, some ridiculous and others that seemed plausible. Once you start thinking you know what you should and shouldn't believe then you are a menace to yourself and everyone around you. I have devolved into a permanent state of polite agnosticism. I neither believe nor disbelieve anything at this point. I rather envy this guy."
-There are two prices: the market price (which can make us wealthy) and the cost price (which keeps us financially stable). Most things are expensive due to market pricing, but within a "family" setting, costs are just materials and labor, without market influence. What kinds of setting you want, do you really want a market when some people eg. farmers think you are their family? And what kinds of a family "setting", if your boss didn't pay a market-anchored salary.
