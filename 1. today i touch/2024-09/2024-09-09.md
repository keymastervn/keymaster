- The journey to becoming mindful software engineers should come from top down approach, which he/she has least ideas of a great system, then breaking down to least ideas of great designs, then great implementations. If focusing on just great implementations, he/she will likely get lost.
	- Should have an overview of a great system eg. shortening service, cut it deeply into core components. Providing scenarios when it is not scalable or is stuck in operation / human-back-office issues. Problem appears, then choosing trade-offs.
	- The great softwares' ideas, turn out, become the most suffer things as you can't make it perfect without paying a lot. So "great" means accepted in rationale.
		- The "great softwares" is like the great "AK-47" or "T-34", where everything is balance between what we need and what we want, and the effort to maintain or to extend it. We will learn what should be built and what should be dropped, which is hard.
