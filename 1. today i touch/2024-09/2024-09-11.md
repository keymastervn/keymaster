		- "A monad(3) is a monoid(4) in the category(see 1) of endofunctors(5)‚Äù (1)A category is the prime structure in category theory(see 2). (2)category theory is a ways of connecting vague mathematical concepts by similar structures of objects from these different theories/concepts. A collection of such connections between objects (and the objects themselves) may be called a category(see 1). (3)A monad can be easily(6) followed on from (1) (2). (4)A monoid can easily(6) be followed on from (1) (2). (5)Blumming magic. (6)10-15 different steps at least" :v
		- "Asking what is a monad is similar, in a sense, to asking what a vector space is. It is a collection of objects related by operations and a few rules. In the case of vector spaces, the objects are vectors and the operations are vector addition and scalar multiplication. The rules are that these operations are closed and follow rules of linear combination. For monads (from a programming POV), the objects are type constructor functions. The operation is just one, function composition. The rules are that there is a unity function, that when composed with other constructor, returns the same one as if the composition was never done. And that function composition is associative (no need to use parenthesis to specify order of composition). That is it."
