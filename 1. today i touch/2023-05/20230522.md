Poisoning the well can be a special case of¬†_[argumentum ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem "Ad hominem")_, and the term was first used with this sense by¬†[John Henry Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Newman "John Henry Newman")¬†in his work¬†_[Apologia Pro Vita Sua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologia_Pro_Vita_Sua "Apologia Pro Vita Sua")_¬†(1864).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well#cite_note-walton-1)¬†The etymology of the phrase lies in¬†[well poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_poisoning "Well poisoning"), an ancient wartime practice of pouring poison into sources of¬†[fresh water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water "Fresh water")¬†before an invading army, to diminish the invading army's strength.

	- I am a wolf chasing inner peace. I release the toxic outside to feed my shadows with joy and embrace together to borrow each other's strength. Most of the time, it is Key Master, who is wise and intelligence, or Iilies a cunning monster, or Naturelius a reflection, a calm lake.
