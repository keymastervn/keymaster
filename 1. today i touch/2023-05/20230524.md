- adversarial vs skeptical 
- Maybe, "passive agressive" is the right word ![[Screenshot 2023-05-24 at 15.21.53.png]]

	- "_You are definitely allowed to shoot yourself in the foot, if you really want to_", true lmao
- If you want someone to love you forever, it won't make sense. You want some one to like you for a very long time makes more sense.
	- But for girls, they "want to keep" what is so-called love forever, consistently from the first day to the last day on earth. You know why it couldn't last forever: life matters, people change, everything change, even the earth changes. It really asks you to be stupid or to manage your life really well for protecting your love.
		- And you know what, boys can, but girls they tend to put all things in just one box. AND eventually they blame why people change. AND in a love course, you have to share the context to the other.
			- Women are conceptually a well-accepted paradox
		- Bad boys consistently love themselves, they just lie to girls/women that they loved them. There comes another truth: your attitude towards yourself is a different context (well-managed) and is less likely to change. That's why narcissist is a hard problem.
