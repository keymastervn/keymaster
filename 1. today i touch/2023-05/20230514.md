- Where pg_search handles rank + order with rank https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search/blob/7a01eddf66db5e9310d995babd83742fce753b14/lib/pg_search/scope_options.rb#LL21C1-L22C1
	- The problem is: if I want to order by `date` before `rank` which is a tie-creator, what will be the best strategy?
	- eg. in '2023-05-14', than sort by rank, then break by id --> is it good?
	- how should we call this abstraction ie. naming?
