"For example, distinguishing when acts areÂ [courageous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage "Courage"), as opposed toÂ [reckless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_\(psychology\) "Recklessness (psychology)")Â orÂ [cowardly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowardice "Cowardice"), is an act of prudence"
