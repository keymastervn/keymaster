		- "Jozef Steinhübl, a 15-year-old hacker that goes by the name xhyrom on GitHub, built a Zed Discord presence extension. No, we don't offer any Discord features in the extension API. Jozef still made it work by — get this — building a language server that communicates with Zed to figure out which files the user has open and then broadcasting that to Discord. Where one person sees a limitation, another person sees the eye of a needle through which they can thread their ideas. Beautiful."

It allows export of GPUs to only 18 countries. Nationalization with American characteristics. It tells **the other 177 countries that they should plan on purchasing their AI infrastructure from China**."
