	- Let's not talk about Social Mobility, but [Plato's Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)). A just is a just if we have people do their own jobs with limited ownership.
		- Socrates then asks his interlocutors for a definition of justice. Three are suggested:
			- [Cephalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalus "Cephalus"): To give each what is owed to them (331c)
			- Polemarchus: To give to each what is appropriate to him (332c)
			- [Thrasymachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasymachus "Thrasymachus"): What is advantageous for the stronger (338c)
		- "Everyone would prefer to get away with harm to others without suffering it themselves, but since they cannot, they agree not to do harm to others so as not to suffer it themselves"
		- "They also decide to regulate narrative and musical style so as to encourage the four¬†[cardinal virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues "Cardinal virtues"): wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. Socrates avers that beautiful style and morally good style are the same. In proposing their program of censored education, they are repurifying the luxurious or feverish city" -> Here comes Prudence, mother of all virtues arises
			- "In Aristotle's¬†_[Rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric_\(Aristotle\) "Rhetoric (Aristotle)")_, we read: The forms of Virtue are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, wisdom."
		- Plato's five regimes (of which four are unjust):  aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny
			- Aristocracy, the concept of aristocracy according to¬†[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")¬†has an ideal state ruled by the¬†[philosopher king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_king "Philosopher king"). Plato describes "philosopher kings" as "those who love the sight of truth" 
			- A timocracy, in choosing its leaders, is "inclining rather to the more high-spirited and simple-minded type, who are better suited for war" eg. Sparta, [stratocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratocracy "Stratocracy")
		- "Sometimes we let **our passions rule our actions or way of thinking**, although they should be controlled, so that we can increase our **happiness**."
		- https://zshn25.github.io/plato-republic/#what-is-justice
			- "This distinction between seeming to be just, and being just is characterized by the question, ‚Äúif one removes all the consequences of being unjust, doesn‚Äôt a just person act same as a unjust person?‚Äù" üß†
