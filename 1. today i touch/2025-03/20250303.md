	- "The knowledge funnel has three different phases: Mystery → Heuristic → Algorithm"
		- "Martin argues that business is currently missing [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning"), the third form of logic ([deductive logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_logic "Deductive logic") and [inductive logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic "Inductive logic") being other two). [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce") formed the idea of abductive logic, arguing that no new idea could come from inductive or deductive logic. Peirce described the process of discovery as new ideas that arose when thinkers observed data that did not fit with the existing models. The first step of reasoning was not observation but wondering"

"Apple Inc.") under [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "Steve Jobs")."
