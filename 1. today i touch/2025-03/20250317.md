	- "- The ideal unit of delegation is a crisp, _simple_, high-level goal, with limited overlap with other workstreams. (This is as opposed to, e.g., a list of tasks like “see if X helps.“) Good examples: “get X training technique working over Y networking protocol at Z throughput,” “get identical evals between model implementations A and B.” Bad examples: “follow this 10-step checklist that we hope results in training working,” “try these 3 techniques for debugging the loss eval.”"
	- "- The best project-managers are often _not_ the strongest technical ICs. Instead the most important traits are that they’re highly organized and great at staying laser focused on end goals, perhaps to the point of being annoying about it. IC depth helps and I’ll never say no to it, but it’s not what I’d optimize for."
	- "- People running subprojects are probably also doing a lot of the same stuff I do, in particular e.g. spending a lot of time on it. That means they’ll take a substantial hit to their IC productivity. This is expected, and is often worth it. “Direction is more important than magnitude”—it’s usually better to have a lower-velocity project that works on the right things, than a higher-velocity one that’s pointed at the wrong goal."
	- "“Keep goals simple” doesn’t have to mean “do less”—the best way to keep goals simple is to _find the latent structure that enables a clean recursive decomposition into subgoals_"

		- "... but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood why. The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with investors. The problem is that once you start raising money, raising money becomes the top idea in your mind. That becomes what you think about when you take a shower in the morning. And that means other questions aren't"
		- "Even Newton fell into this trap. After publishing his theory of colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years, finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing: I see **I have made myself a slave to Philosophy**, but if I get free of Mr Linus's business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally, excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come out after me. For I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or **become a slave to defend it**."
