- Can AI feel time? I guess no.
- I don't know whether pgvector (relational) is more convenient than OpenSearch (document-based) or not. But for embedding_v2 v3, overriding documents is somehow more frustrated than just add an embedding field in Postgres, because OpenSearch updating often involves re-indexing the entire document or using specific update APIs
	- Querying performance and functionalities, OpenSearch win for sure. But writing is a hmm.
	- For large scale application, OpenSearch is a choice, but we have to maintain a cluster and a magnitute of data pipeline. Postgres with pgvector is relatively simple comparing to that architecture, but bangging our mother db is not a good thing (poorer isolation)
