	- While there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that LLMs are poor planners, it’s unclear whether it’s because we don’t know how to use LLMs the right way or because LLMs, **fundamentally**, **can’t plan**. **Planning, at its core, is a search problem**. You search among different paths towards the goal, predict the outcome (reward) of each path, and pick the path with the most promising outcome. Often, you might determine that no path exists that can take you to the goal.
		- This means that **prompting a model to generate only a sequence of actions like what the popular chain-of-thought prompting technique does isn’t sufficient**. The paper “[Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992)” (Hao et al., 2023) argues that an LLM, by containing so much information about the world, **is capable of predicting the outcome of each action**. This LLM can incorporate this outcome prediction to generate coherent plans.
		- Even if AI can’t plan, it can still be a part of a planner. It might be possible to augment an LLM with a search tool and state tracking system to help it plan.
		- Plan is the workflows, which need our specification in prior.
