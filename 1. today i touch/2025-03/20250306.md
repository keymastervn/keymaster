	- "The true test of an AGI is it's ability to assimilate disparate information into a coherent world-view, which is effectively what the pretraining is doing. And even then, it is likely that any intelligence capable of doing that will need to be "preloaded" with assumptions about the world it will occupy, structurally. Similar to the regions of the brain which are adept at understanding spatial relationships, or language, or interpreting our senses, etc."
		- "People keep thinking "General" means one AI can "do everything that any human can do everywhere all at once"."
		- "If the machine can decide how to train itself (adjust weights) when faced with a type of problem it hasn’t seen before, then I don’t think that would go against the spirit of general intelligence. I think that’s basically what humans do when they decide to get better at something, they figure out how to practice that task until they get better at it."

	- "For child, being precocious in a subject is usually a curse. Being bright and a generally fast learner is also a trap. Hitting the wall is inevitable for almost everyone, but until that point your self-image is built on forward velocity, and especially relative velocity — you’re just faster than your peers. Turns out there are faster kids, they just aren’t at your school. Parents can make this worse but it’s pretty hard to prevent it."
		- Damn, true
