		- "For instance, if I were helping to design a society, I might be tempted to try to **make sure that society is set up to benefit philosophers**, or men, or people who love science fiction novels. But if I don’t know any of those facts about myself, I can’t be tempted. The Veil is meant to ensure that people’s concern for their personal benefit could translate into a set of arrangements that were fair for everyone, assuming that they had to stick to those choices once the Veil of Ignorance ‘lifts’, and they are given full information again"

	- John Stuart Mill is my former justice teacher. Following him, I am "still" a fair person. I don't need intimacy as well as I don't weight them in any decisions. I don't have society but myselves. While I try not making you feel dangerous about me, I won't make you feel belonging or cohesive at all; if you feel that I am dangerous, it is because you are stuck in the casual binary thinking (it is a disease of not growing up enough). I don't know much about things, I keep saying "tôi sẽ không bao giờ biết cái tôi không biết" as a disclaimer and a lifelong frustration. I have my own strong identity and I am totally biases, but I deliberately choose to be fair in most circumstances, being deliberately objective alone. I don't care about you, but when I care, I silently cry.
