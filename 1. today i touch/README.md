The views expressed on here are my own, or my self-reflection to others, and not necessarily that of my employer or any other entity with which I have been, am now, or will be affiliated.
I am very, very subject to change.

I occasionally touch things, ingest them slowly, and judge them according to my knowledge, values, and beliefs even though I always incline to be aware of the context. I also relax myself to keep me from being fainted through irrelevant stuff that I unconsciously take it at my daily dose. If a connection between written items isn't broken down into bullet points, I'll assume it's probably incorrect (*unless being digested*), so don't guess.

I write to stop overthinking and because I seriously care about who I will become.

The concerns are mostly about #philosophy, #communication, #selfawareness, #selfmanagement, #softwareengineering , maybe #art.
