- let's see how the world is shining with policy-based access control
	- https://github.com/coaxsoft/passpartu
		- with a yaml file. looks like role-based, dear mommy
	- https://github.com/rails-engine/role_core role-based engine?
		- I basically hate roles; up side: simple, very simple; down side: very hard to change as it is simple, your mommy says no exception for a roles but there will be exceptions (as software reflects real-world context) so phew, policy-based is advocated.

	- "We are at a similar crisis point with our GCP bills. We are quite a bit smaller than 37signals and spent about $600k last year to support 100k DAU with a headcount almost exactly like 37signals. It's just deeply out of hand. Like 37signals, we are a lifestyle business and we have no VC money to burn, so this is really painful."
	- seems like, the cost of making it resilient is the critical point, but some services/businesses does need that 99.9xx% at extra 15% operational cost.
	- "I’ve worked with companies who spend over $300m/year on cloud compute. I think this is a major disconnect in tech because management generally tries to insulate engineers so much from the financials that they don’t even know how much the products they are building cost to run. Many engineers would be shocked if the knew the bill."
		- "Most good engineers know how much it's costing, but nobody cares" -> agree, in SE most things are trade-offs, if it creates lullabies then why we have to care (at the first priority), very big hmm
			- But honestly, if I were a dev turned into business owner, cost is the top 1-2 priority. People that can save cloud cost, is a cost saver. In some scenarios, they save much than their salary (cost-wise, again)
