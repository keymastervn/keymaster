- The most scalable yet simple design is to fan-in, fan-out for scalability, but additional calls to the middle field must be well accepted
	- feed in -> write events
	- feed out -> read events
		- vs feed in -> feed out
- So, you've made an endpoint that is handling too much unnecessary validation logic. You think when /manager handles manager logic and /employee handles employee logic it is better than /user with custom validations. And you want to migrate that, follow me
	- /user should accept a custom param like /user?flow=\[employee, manager\]
	- you build two service object to work on the params
	- you (1) keep the /user, and introduce /employee + /manager
	- you tell the FE to switch endpoints
	- you sunset /user
