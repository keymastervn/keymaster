	- Same in principle but SoC alone doesn't appear to discourage over-separation. Overseparation isn't as bad as overcoupling, but it's bad, because it raises the cost of construction and maintaining the software (same problem as overcoupling - different reasons). SoC demands two very important success factors, at least per uncle bob (1) 'concerns' are business-level first (not tech); (2) Separating things that belong together is a mistake. [blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/…](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html)

	- "A carefully developed monolith with attention paid to reasonable boundaries that can later be split off into individual services may be the ideal way to start, in my opinion. Maintaining this sort of discipline for any length of time is difficult as scope and staffing levels grow, though, and is likely why we see efforts start with an over-engineered set of services, or build what will become an unwieldy monolith needing substantial rework later to divide into smaller components."
