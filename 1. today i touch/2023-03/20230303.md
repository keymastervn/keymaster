- https://failsafe.dev/retry/ a very functional approach
	- "Failsafe policies add resilience by detecting failures and handling them. Each policy determines which execution [results or exceptions](https://failsafe.dev/javadoc/core/dev/failsafe/FailurePolicyBuilder.html) to consider as failures and how to handle them. By default, policies handle any `Exception` that is thrown. But policies can also be configured to handle more specific exceptions or conditions:"

	- built-in policies that Failsafe supports:
		-   [Retry](https://failsafe.dev/retry)
		-   [Circuit Breaker](https://failsafe.dev/circuit-breaker)
		-   [Rate Limiter](https://failsafe.dev/rate-limiter)
		-   [Timeout](https://failsafe.dev/timeout)
		-   [Bulkhead](https://failsafe.dev/bulkhead)
		-   [Fallback](https://failsafe.dev/fallback)
	- our CustomReport is cool somehow, as failure won't block user from giving another try, which can pass on X attempts (when system is on minor outage)

		- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46409 this solution: cache + moneypatch, and the author also tells more approaches
			- Store TypeMap into SchemaCache (relevant for PG only)
			- Switch off TypeMap if there is no usage of PG custom types
			- Introduce the monkey patch as the solution for Rails
