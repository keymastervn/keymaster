	- "Senior engineers should do architecture. But a lot of the senior engineers I know aren't senior in their capabilities. I have very commonly seen developers promoted to senior after 5 years, just when those developers are starting to get good at their job. Time isn't the only factor in developing skill and seniority but developers of 5 years still need a lot of mentorship. They _**should**_ be heavily involved in architecture, but with a mentor. The good architects I've seen are incredible mentors."
