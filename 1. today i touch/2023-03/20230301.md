- Hello March, I remember in the old tales of Andersen, March stories are the best one so I love March. I also love March, it means the birthday are gone, I am now 31 => 7.75.
- I don't need foreign keys: Read is safe but for CUD operations, it suffers unwanted deadlocks. Try other ways to ensure referential consistency (which you and me agree are very unlikely to change) in pessimistic manner: if none then raise and delete.
	- I agree on some niche datatypes/domains such as finance, we can use foreign key. BUT, you may understand the relationship between entities wrong, Here, transaction + advisory lock (manual) is a better tool.
	- async can't help, defer to outside of rush hour can't help as multi operations are still blocking each other
	- not, trying to pursuit a non-realtime referential consistency, eg. callback/background job check (but it costs more IO => eventually pessimistic manner)

- a world is war-safe is it is entangled in a dead lock situation that no countries move.
