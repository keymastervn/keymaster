- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law a formula which gives the theoretical [speedup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedup "Speedup") in [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering) "Latency (engineering)") of the execution of a task at fixed [workload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload "Workload") that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved. Amdahl's law is often used in [parallel computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing "Parallel computing") to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors

		- "Little's law is useful because it gives us a clear way to reason about the capacity of a system" can defend yourself from Kimmie's question: how much resource you want to raise for a service :haha:
		- "_The system was ticking along nicely, then just after midnight a spike of requests from arrived from a flash sale. This caused latency to increase because of increased lock contention on the database, which in turn caused 10% of client calls to time-out and be retried. A bug in backoff in our client meant that this increased call rate to 10x the normal for this time of day, further increasing contention._ And so on..." the art of storytelling

	- Why Linux is more secure than Windows :hmm:
		- Windows uses active directory + LDAP, whereas a file/folder is control under a tree of groups/departments.
			- Easy to go
			- Like you are somebody, you can do something. But everyone wants to be somebody.
		- Linux has simple 3 bits permissions (read, write, execute), with 3 simple user groups (owner, group, everyone) [ref](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/183994/understanding-unix-permissions-and-file-types)
			- looks simple, but the permission matrix is not easy to handle.
			- down to zero-context awareness. OS checks permission on the file system everytime
		- Side: A policy-based authorization structure is not always 3 bits perm x 3 bits group. It could be n x m. Ironically, your app is more complex than your OS in term of auth.
