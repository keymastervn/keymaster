	- I’m finally seeing incredible results in the field, things that looked like sci-fi a few years ago are now possible: Claude AI is my reasoning / editor / coding partner lately. I’m able to accomplish a lot more than I was able to do in the past. I often do *more work* because of AI, but I do better work. Recently I wrote a sci-fi short story for an Italian publisher, and thanks to Claude criticizing parts of it I rewrote the ending and produced a much better work (I didn’t let Claude write a single line of the story or the plot: **great use of AI is not making machines do what you can do better**)

	- "How did Intel’s “fall from grace” happen? What should managers learn from this story?"
	- "What happened to Intel falls into two “buckets.” One involves the challenge of dominating a highly profitable market without having the foresight, ability, or flexibility to adapt to new technologies and customers (for example, mobile and AI) as they emerged. A second relates to the consequences of maintaining a strategic commitment (such as in-house manufacturing) that has become outdated. Intel’s determination to keep making its own microprocessors had been an advantage, but it became a liability as advanced semiconductor manufacturing evolved into a highly specialized capability, separable from design"
	- "Platform Leadership: The Blessing and the Curse"
		- "In 1965, while working for Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore looked at several years of data. He observed that semiconductor devices were doubling in power (number of transistors on a silicon wafer) every year or so. Looking forward, he reasoned that computers would someday be cheap and ubiquitous. Moore and Bob Noyce—coinventor of the integrated circuit—founded Intel in 1968 with venture capitalist Arthur Rock precisely to keep pushing forward Moore’s Law and master the mass production of increasingly powerful semiconductor devices"
			- Similar to the idea that AI will be cheap to be generally public: a very simple observation that makes it to be all about timing, but who didn't think about it is simply incompetent enough.
	- I think it depends on the CEO responsibilities: getting numbers and closing gaps, or envisioning a strategy. IMHO, executions are no less important than strategies.
