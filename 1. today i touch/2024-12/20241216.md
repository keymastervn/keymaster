	- t=17:25 the called "strategy of Russian Mir"
	- t=21:18 in a war, truth is the first victim. I can't believe both sides. Let's say Putin lost Syria, halts Kursk now, and is advancing in Donbass.
		- Well I hope, no one will do the disgusting thing like "Bucha" and say "it's war"
	- t=36:30 war of attrition, logistic matters.
	- t=56:00 "Will look at the fate of the Russian Federation, be afraid of America, be afraid of democracy, never break international law" but... don't threaten others my friend, you are adding shadow to what have been seemingly lost at the beginning. Let's say "Ukr - liberation" and done.
		- Because the first thing of the "be afraid of America, be afraid of democracy, never break international law" has been breaking its third hard, the Uncle has set many unlawful precedents. Maidan, Hillary Clinton, Donbass, Sevastopol, Russia, NATO, ... have had reasons. I have been looking at all of you since the beginning.
	- t=59:30 yes, it's fine to keep supporting Ukr and it's even better to make a deal to ceasefire. Lesson learnt: it [took](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accords) Vietnam ~4 years from 1968 to 1973 to come to a final agreement, what will be your compromises?

		- "in a couple decades there won't be many people who can write" are those who can't deploy their ideas.
		- "To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard"
		- "So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too." "Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who choose to be." "There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be"
			- Same for those who choose to learn math and philosophy, there are less and less wise people, more and more <s>happier</s> entertained people
				- https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/42294-the-science-of-government-it-is-my-duty-to-study "I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain."
	- Still, the easiest way to be wise is to write essays: to concretize with numbers and facts, to self-do anti-thesis, to not write but still be able to deliver ideas, ... totally a game of perfectionist and absolute art. Easiest way means no other ways.
	- I still like the old email communication, "please be informed that, please kindly review this prop, looking forward to hearing feedback", it is formal as dead machine, but it has certain clarity

	- "Truffle Ruby is 50-100% faster in most tests. But uses 5-10x more memory. Still has way more upside left to gain."
	- "Sorbet uses a kind of type annotation, its very ugly and I do not like it. I really would prefer something more built into the language. Like def foo(Integer x) -> Integer. The big issue is method arguments I think since Ruby already uses :x, x:, x =, and a lot of the other symbols that indicate types so its hard to add it in an optional fashion."

	- "Over a four-year period, one staffing firm operator used a dozen companies to enter the same applicants as many as 15 times, securing hundreds of H-1Bs while others lost out."
