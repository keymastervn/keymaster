	- Real dependency injection with Railway is to focus on chaining unique atomic operations, not repeatedly define them in a specified context. But still, it makes you crazy. And still, can you guess how many things in life are relevant?

	- https://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html "It's worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is tending to become in our own time. It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model"
		- https://paulgraham.com/diff.html "Over time, the default language, embodied in a succession of popular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp. 1-5 are now widespread. 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream. Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be any syntax for it. 8, which (with 9) is what makes Lisp macros possible, is so far still unique to Lisp, perhaps because (a) it requires those parens, or something just as bad, and (b) if you add that final increment of power, you can no longer claim to have invented a new language, but only to have designed a new dialect of Lisp ; -)"

		- In university, it usually costs 3 credits to learn OOP (each credit is equivalent to 30-45 hours), so it takes at least 90 hours to digest what OOP really is
		- I learned OOP twice (and DSA 4 times), however, the last time I learnt it with Java so it didn't count

	- "Khalifa cho rằng giới lãnh đạo HTS thực dụng và ít mang tính ý thức hệ hơn. Theo chuyên gia này, al-Shara không phải là một giáo sĩ, mà là một chính trị gia sẵn sàng thỏa hiệp về nhiều thứ, nhưng luôn kiên định với mục tiêu chống lại chính quyền Syria."
	- Không ít thất bại có tính chóng vánh như thất bại của Assad tại Syria, những thất bại như vậy không chỉ đến từ mất mát tinh thần, bất kì nhà quân sự chính trị nào cũng phải nghiên cứu rất kỹ. Nó là yếu tố của "decisive victory", một trận chiến phá hủy được hoàn toàn tinh thần hay năng lực chiến đấu của đối phương
