	- https://calmcode.io/human-learn/introduction.html "[Human-Learn](https://koaning.github.io/human-learn/index.html)Â contains scikit-learn compatible tools that should make it easier to construct and benchmark rule based systems that are designed by humans. You can also use it in combination with ML models. In this series of videos we'll demonstrate some of the features."

	- https://parsec.app/technology "Parsec's core technology suite, the Parsec SDK, is built in cross platform C. We take a strong stand against unnecessary bloat, complexity, and dependencies of dubious value. Even our host side WebRTC implementation (for our web client) was custom built without requiring Google's massive dependency tree." "We use our own peer-to-peer networking protocol called BUD; Better User Datagrams (naming is hard). BUD has been optimized for low-latency video delivery based on the data gathered over a three year period. With a 97% NAT traversal success rate and lightning fast adjustment to packet loss and congestion, BUD is the cornerstone of the Parsec SDK" -> wow a trailblazer.
