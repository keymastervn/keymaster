		- I have been on a no fking care mode when thinking about my contribution to OSS, because of what: most of them are left unmerged. Due to (1) mountains of bad notifications (notifications become noises) in Github, it knows your primary org so why not classify noti into `operational`, why not default to "off" then suggest people turn it "on" eventually? and (2) the author doesn't really care about a solution if it is not their problem OR not on a roadmap, sometimes it is better to invite your coworkers into the same thread to raise a voice.
			- I won't solve this because it's a life issue hehe.
			- Managing OSS is not easy, it has been on low motivation. Big corps should take projects and commit to them, in a non-profit manner.
