	- "Because synchronous producing is a performance killer and scales very poorly, it is effectively bound by network and broker latency. If the round-trip to produce a message is 2ms the maximum achievable rate is 500 messages per second. In scenarios where the broker or network is getting slower for whatever reason this rate decreases even more, possibly causing backpressure in the application affecting the upstream data source."
