	- "Messages in Redis Pub/Sub are not persistent. Once a message is sent and received by all subscribers, it is not stored in Redis. If a subscriber is not connected when a message is published, it will not receive that message." => ZERO COPY technique, this means very very fast, no overhead, like Kafka
		- What if the consumer rate is not balance, does it mean "message lost"? Does it mean that I have to throttle it at publisher end?
		- If we want persistence, let's use [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/streams/)
	- https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/messaging/ posted somewhere I recall
		- **Redis Streams** doubles as a communication channel for building streaming architectures and as a log-like data structure for persisting data, making Streams the perfect solution for event sourcing.
			- Remeber, it is an **at-least-once** system
		- **Redis Pub/Sub** is an extremely lightweight messaging protocol designed for broadcasting live notifications within a system. It’s ideal for propagating short-lived messages when low latency and huge throughput are critical.
		- **Redis Lists and Redis Sorted Sets** are the basis for implementing message queues. They can be used both directly to build bespoke solutions, or via a framework that makes message processing more idiomatic for your programming language of choice.
			- Sorted Set can guarantee order of parallel execution

		- "queue-based or stream-based solutions"
			- Queue-based: "In practice, these message inboxes are like task queues", "Some of these frameworks are “humble” task queues such as [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) (Ruby), [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) (Python), [Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/) (Python), etc. Others are “more serious” enterprise service buses (ESBs), like [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) (C#), [MassTransit](https://masstransit-project.com/) (C#), [Apache Synapse](https://synapse.apache.org/) (Java) or [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/) (Java)"
			- Stream-based: append-only at producer, tail at consumer
				- "The main concept here is that what we previously described as tasks/messages, would now be an event"
				- "First of all, note that what Redis calls a “**stream**,” Kafka calls a “topic partition,” and in Kafka, streams are a completely different concept that revolves around processing the contents of a Kafka topic"
- The "Full-snack" mindset may be not good, because sometimes you have another easier way to "make it work in frontend" which is very very prone to making tech debts.
