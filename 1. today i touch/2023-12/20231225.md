- https://github.com/karafka/karafka/blob/master/lib/karafka.rb#L43-L45 Karafka producer, I want to fix the issue of not using 2 separated clients for each sync/async producer. Can it be fairly busy inside a connection pool?
	- https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool "If all the objects in the connection pool are in use, `with` will block until one becomes available. If no object is available within `:timeout` seconds, `with` will raise a `ConnectionPool::TimeoutError` (a subclass of `Timeout::Error`)"
		- As the context is not in distributed, a connection pool of 3 Kafka clients is reasonable
			- TopicManager
			- SyncProducer
			- AsyncProducer
		- Or create 3 Kafka clients at once
		- Or init then `producer.close` similarly to Karafka, https://karafka.io/docs/Producing-messages/#closing-producer-used-in-sidekiq at TopicManager or AsyncProducer.

		- https://github.com/segmentio/topicctl can we use tool like this to check topic? But why we have to do so?
		- `Karafka::Admin.cluster_info` check this, where in the lifecycle they did it, should be one-off fetching not a scheduled task, right?
