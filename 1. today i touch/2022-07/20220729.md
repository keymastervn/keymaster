	- anh Nam Ho mentioned about the thread local variable for tenant data, this is a reflection on "global context", DHH ack-ed it as "powerful" which I totally agree, but the usage is against the CSP model of communicating by using the same shared object -> it will be okay, as long as no write are made. But who knows when comfortable is promoted and devs are wild in nature, they do things that makes them happy.

		- A word of caution: It's easy to overdo a global singleton like Current and tangle your model as a result. Current should only be used for a few, top-level globals, like account, user, and request details. The attributes stuck in Current should be used by more or less all actions on all requests. If you start sticking controller-specific attributes in there, you're going to create a mess.
