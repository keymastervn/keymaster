	- my requirement
		- I don't want to return 429 or 5xx as requests are denied
		- what I want: i want these requests to be throttled, slowly processing with an amount of X request within a time frame Y seconds
		- context: an external trusted party can have a message queue, if they crashed or failed, then recover so they may send huge request at a time -> potential DDos our service
			- rate limit: will deny, i don't want that because i trust their data
			- throttled within a queue: yeah, let's have a brake
