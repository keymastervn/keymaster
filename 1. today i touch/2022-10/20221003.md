- How to track a job progress across services?
	- the caller has a non-blocking tracker service with uuid 
		- all external calls no matter sync/async => ids in the array `[]` => pipeline sequence
			- persistent? maybe a table in a DB, but I prefer dedicated redis instance + dedicated web service (progress-service)
		- the request to check the progress can be externally RESTful, or internally RPC
		- the orchestration: a bus `Progress.Update` having uuid, statuses[] of the pipeline
			- feel like CircleCI
	- Make sure it is not blocking anything but to provide visualisation/UX
	- How to calculate the absolute progress of time, instead of tasks done/total but not machine learning.

		- **Performance** - Using a transaction will consume more resources on the DB server than the raw queries.
		- **Complexity** - When overused, transactions can make your code more brittle and harder to understand.
