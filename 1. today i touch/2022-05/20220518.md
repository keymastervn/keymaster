- The EH sidekiq safe "retry" with "retry" means a non blocking backoff retry perhaps
	- why non-blocking on async processing is important, because it couldn't scale well, imagine a http client like faraday fetchs an url in background job but occasionally retry 3 times -> ultimately made that worker stuck in that job a very long time
	- PERHAPS sidekiq batch (pro) is suffering the same thing with retry, right? the parent job spawns children, then children retry -> the success/death handler will never get called then the parent job stuck
