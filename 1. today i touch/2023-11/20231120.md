They are having 3 options (1) running on their own foot as they are now at certain level of maturity (2) turn their back against MSFT then seek for partnership with old giants eg. IBM/Oracle or new giants eg. Google -> what a dilemma, they can't be independent as said, but this makes them powerful (3) continue to coop with MSFT, this is strategically makes sense BECAUSE both OpenAI and MSFT won't want scenario2 to happen. But this relationship is an attachment more than cooperation.
