	- https://viblo.asia/p/performance-optimization-106-caching-con-duong-lam-chong-gai-XL6lA07AZek cache hit ratio should be > 80%
		- https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3690-the-performance-impact-of-russian-doll-caching "...with a 0.5% hit rate... Because these filters are **based on who is on a project and what todos are due when**, the cache here is busted every time project access or any todo is updated" => cache will miss in specialised context.

- https://tonyarcieri.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-nio4r let's think about I/O blocking time. Given the scenario that your thread is has only 3ms I/O runtime but it has to wait 997ms for another service eg. Search Engine.

- https://github.com/rails/solid_cache#solid-cache "Using SQL databases backed by SSDs we can have caches that are much larger and cheaper than traditional memory only Redis or Memcached backed caches."
	- So, regarding the movement of Redis coming down from RAM persistency to SSD (disk) consistency. Disk is becoming the fast-cheap acceptable data layer, if we accept the 'non-distributed' nature 
	- not LRU cache, use FIFO with longer time-span.
