- Attack on Titan: time traveling is cool, but foreshadowing is very classic. AOT has time traveling in combination with foreshadowing based on "preserved memory" and "seeing future" is a magnum opus in story telling.
	- No one has ever done it before. Storytellers (mostly Marvel) use it to erase something/a mistake rather than respect the reality, which breaks the linear logic of time. People seem to love this mindf^ck feeling, like Christopher Nolan, he made his film for so-so smart people.
		- However, Nolan creates an imposter syndrome for dumb people. They appear "I get it", but they didn't, until someone enlighten them with a real critical review.
		- But before someone arises, KOLs start eating their brains, creating a fake culture first. Be wise! This is the era of "mạt văn".
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superiority_complex, I am not, but my actions create this feeling towards people. We are all equal, being stupid is a choice, I hate stupid because it creates inequality, but I don't hate stupid people. I love all kinds of education including talking to stupidity because we can learn something from it, always.
