- https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html backbone of [polyphony](https://github.com/digital-fabric/polyphony), "it makes sense to have an API that has very low performance overheads", "Because of the shared ring buffers between the kernel and user space, io_uring can be a zero-copy system. Copying bytes around becomes necessary when system calls that transfer data between kernel and user space are involved"
- There is one thing related to psychology I have to answer myself. I have two communication modes (1) sharp outside, soft inside (2) soft outside, sharp inside. I usually use (1) to speak to juniors or strangers while (2) for the elderly people, my love, my bosses/seniors
	- The problem is, **I use (1) for my best friend**, he knows me so much; while he is actually not a stranger, am I thinking that he is a junior?
		- **I also use (1) to me**; I don't think that myself, including shadow self is a stranger or a junior. How can I explain why i am not easy/soft to myself?
			- Apparently, the majority of people is on the side of being soft to themselves to make their feeling easy.
	- It is "usually" because depending on someone's first impression, I may behave differently. It is a config I can manage based on a specific context. Don't count me in extrovert/introvert, it is invalid to me in general.
	- Juniors are usually soft towards me, they SHOULD, for (a) learning attitude; and I should be sharp, for (b) solving problems. The same position if I am talking to seniors. It should have nothing to do with "respect to seniority" aka "senpai culture" as we human mutually respect.
		- I want to say, it does not always work this way, and it's GOOD. Sometimes, all of us have to be neutral to make the stance balance to focus on the problem.
		- Using the wrong stance for bad purposes is toxic. The degree of this should be mutually exclusive to keep the atmosphere balanced.
