	- t=80s he indeed mentioned "Culture", yes, culture is an important indicator. Many people view someone's actions as his/her culture creating some misleading conclusions. Culture is the making of behaviors intrinsically. Some other guys will move similarly create a pattern, but before having a pattern these are human actions.
	- t=400s "higher is not better": we will go to hell by the paradox of choice. Our life are destined for something but we only have about 100 years to do it. It means that we are having a constraint that should deny over-X including over-consciousness for jumping into something when it is enough.
	- t=1200s he likes meeting the people at level 7 because these people know the "balance". Meaning that from here, they saw levels above them already and they knew that moving upwards has "no-better" things. Personally, I don't know if I am >= 7 or not, I can't evaluate myself above 6, literally no ideas to say it is nope or yes, sometimes is not sometimes in 8 and above. All I can say is that I am "super lost".
