- https://www.lypham.net/?p=13334 what is the meaning of equality?
	- Personally speaking, I am sick of democracy; it is, by somehow, attached closely to "freedom". However, democracy is something only available in the social context. In the Social Contract Locke said that one must sacrifice his own freedom to be protected by the community, so "freedom" is not about living in democracy, it is indeed to deny "democracy". So "freedom", "freewill" is not directly related to democracy
		- Not directly because many ideas in the social context are relevant but contradictory ie. laws, which are designed for preventing some actions creates "freedom". We become civil by laws and when I say it this way, you can feel no "freedom".
	- Some self-taught liars know the holy grail to occupy the sweetest part from "democracy" just for their own "freedom".
		- Self-taught because historically, it is the written feudalism. The vacuum of power and distribution of good creates influence which is used to "fake democracy". So they are liars.
	- Instead, I praise "equality", but it is getting cancer from the faked democracy. My position is not being a leftist or rightist; Politically, I am standing in the middle ground, I am amongst those who are not extreme but are losing voice because of not being bold/toxic enough.

	- Equality of being the victim and the culprit. Depending on contexts, If we viewed up-and-up-and-up, everything are correlated.
