- Every programmer should be able to write code for other human to read, not machine. But when asking for codereview, why they have to make it structural (item:A, problem:B, summary:C) like it is for machine. Take it easy man, we are human not machine, know your purposes and don't be overly dogmatic.

	- you may argue that your structure is good and respect machine, well, okay, well. YAGNI. Machine has their own better way to read things; if you ever think so, you'll need to detox your mind because it is a problem: (software) machine is more human today.
