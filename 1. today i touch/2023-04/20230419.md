- Not much things deserve UUID over incremental id, it is fking hard to sort or to find next incremental value by created_at, or indexing the created_at stuff. UUID can be added later, for external context.
- How to refactor unit test using AI, my expectation
	- It must know the implementation eg. `models/abc.rb` before writing `abc_spec.rb`
	- It must know the optimization techniques such as test-prof, test-double/mocks, pruning unnecessary code and data
	- It should know webmock, for something it does not know it has to say "I DONT KNOW, WRITE IT YOURSELF"
	- Its naming must be clear and precise. Given the context that existing test may be not really good to learn.
		- haiz the issue `# fronze_literal_string` =))
	- It won't introduce flaky test, know how to guard flaky possibilities eg. Timecop
		- I won't say, but it must not break the test, the valid of test cases.
	- It must be cost efficient overall, you pay eg. 1000$ credit for GPT-4-turbo to build a fine-tune model and check BUT you have to convince bosses for reducing parts of 20000$ monthly CI cost AND developer time for running tests -> very hard to proove the cherry, you have to place a bet.

		- "Once a programmer knows what to build, the act of writing code can be thought of as (1) breaking a problem down into simpler problems, and (2) mapping those simple problems to existing code (libraries, APIs, or functions) that already exist. The latter activity is probably the least fun part of programming (and the highest barrier to entry), and it’s where OpenAI Codex excels most."
