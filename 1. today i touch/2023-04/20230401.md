- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model "never trust, always verify"
	- The reasoning for zero trust is that the traditional approach — trusting devices within a notional "corporate perimeter", or devices connected via a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network "Virtual private network") — is not relevant in the complex environment of a corporate network. The zero trust approach advocates **mutual authentication**
		- is it meant mutual authentication = peer authentication?

	- "policies can be applied based on the attributes of the data, who the user is, and the type of environment using [Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control "Attribute-based access control")"
- ⭐ Nedlog Rule - The Golden Rule in reverse (palindrome): https://www.connectionculture.com/post/why-you-need-to-practice-the-nedlog-rule **Any time one person reaches out to help another, two people are helped**
	- **The Golden Rule: treating others as one wants to be treated**
		- How that recognition is transacted?
	- The Nedlog Rule (or Elur Nedlog): Don’t do unto yourself anything you wouldn’t do unto someone else
		- Counter examples:
			- Make them go to a holiday event that has a proven history of making them want to jump off a bridge.
			- Require false cheer from them even if they’re feeling sad or anxious.
			- Insist that they give all their loved ones perfect gifts at the perfect moment with the perfect presentation.
			- Hate them for eating too much.
			- Insist that they spend money they don’t really have to please people they don’t really like.
			- Demand high activity from them when they’re tired.
	- Benefits:
		- Passive-aggressive behavior would be replaced by people openly and honestly confronting the issues and discussing their differences.
		- Martyr complex would be replaced by people asking for help before they become overwhelmed, and asking for a break before they reached the breaking point.
		- Chronic complaining would be replaced by people asking for help to fix the problems that can be fixed and for support to cope with the predicaments that are beyond immediate solution (a restatement of the Serenity Prayer).
		- Burnout would be replaced by the sort of collective spirit one sees in a support group, where people who are facing intractable problems reach out to one another to share hope, inspiration, and courage – and a culture where it’s almost impossible to distinguish between helper and helpee.
		- Most important, people would dream bigger dreams, take on more daring risks, and make more substantial commitments knowing that they didn’t have to do it all alone.
