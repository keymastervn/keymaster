		- I know that story between Edison vs. Tesla, DC vs. AC

		- "something like 75% of people surveyed believed they were a "better than average" driver. That clearly looks like a contradiction that implies that people are not objective on self-evaluation" ---------- "If you count only accidents, then the slow pace wins. If you count frustration and lost time, then it won't." Well said.
		- Again, I am defaulted default and stressless in principle. I don't have to setup tools, or my tool is very bare-minimum to get ready into working.

No one can intrinsically get a better self-motivation rather than drived by the feeling of being real useful.
