- SSE is a unidirectional protocol where the server sends data to the client over a long-lived HTTP connection. This makes it easy to implement and use, and it works well for scenarios where the server needs to push updates to the client in real-time. SSE is also a lightweight protocol that uses less bandwidth than WebSocket, making it a good choice for low-bandwidth or mobile networks. WebSocket is a bidirectional protocol that allows both the server and the client to send data to each other over a long-lived TCP connection. This makes it more versatile than SSE and suitable for more complex scenarios where both the server and the client need to send data to each other in real-time. WebSocket is also faster than SSE and has lower latency, making it a good choice for high-performance applications. WebSocket is generally faster and more efficient than SSE, especially for applications that require bidirectional communication. However, SSE is simpler to implement and use, and it can be a good choice for applications that only require unidirectional communication
- Using analogy is a great way to communication (communication layout topic), a language model that is rich in content
