- Alice and The Cheshire Cat:
	- Alice: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
	- The Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
	- Alice: I don't much care where.
	- The Cheshire Cat: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.
	- Alice: ...So long as I get somewhere.
	- The Cheshire Cat: Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough.
	- ‚≠ê learn this lesson: you need to walk long enough to know what you want, even you go wrong is still better than you don't know which way to go.
		- We have to care about our intentions.
