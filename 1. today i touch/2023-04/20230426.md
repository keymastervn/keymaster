- "OpenAI servers can handle a large number of long HTTP requests by using asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O." "In addition to asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O, OpenAI servers also use load balancing and auto-scaling techniques to handle a large number of requests. Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple server instances to ensure that no single instance becomes overloaded. Auto-scaling automatically adds or removes server instances to match the current demand, ensuring that there are always enough resources to handle incoming requests."
