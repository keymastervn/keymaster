	- There are three states of a statement: yes, no, and null. Most people think yes != no, but they don't know for most of the time, yes != null, and no === yes. The more they reject "no", the more it becomes "yes", the only way to kill it is "keep silence"
		- Humblebrag is an example, sometimes you have to keep silence and smile instead of response to a compliment.
		- Same like this question: did you sleep with somebody? It is not a question, the ultimate goal of the question is nonsense and vague, it is to check null and flow control something to another path. Don't answer it.
