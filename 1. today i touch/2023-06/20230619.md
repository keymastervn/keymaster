	- 3D printing is the future for those who embrace it
	- Important like chips (head), it is the chassis (body) of things. We can create thousands of UAV with just plastic. 
	- Definitely there will be harder problems, but you are the maker not scientist. Imagine Leonardo Da Vinci living in a 3D printing era, he would have been inventing a lot
- Sooner or longer with generative AI, you won't trust any image or sound as an evidence to accuse somebody on something bad. It will be more and more sophisticated

	- Feel like a good mental approach: data and context matter most
	- "One of the main objectives of DCI is to improve a developer's understanding of _system-level state and behavior_"
	- it's just another way to represent OOP
	- "A critical constraint of DCI is that these bindings are guaranteed to be in place **only at run time**. In other words, the `Transfer` object will be picked up by the garbage collector afterward, and no trace of the mapped roles remains with the domain models"
		- in shorter language: extend a concern (defined as a role) in runtime
	- You end up mixing a lot of contexts and roles together for a business concern. Maybe you will create _less abstractions_ but mixing them together in a manner of "generic interface" will force you to think hard
		- especially, if your domain business is relatively new OR hacky, you have to break your defined "role" a lot.
		- PORO service object and policy object is enough for disposability and extendability.
