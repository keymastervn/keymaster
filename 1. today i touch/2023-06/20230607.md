	- can prompt to output `UNCERTAIN`? lemme try, I thought we can just prompt "high/low confidence"

		- I am not actually using chain-of-thought approach, because the complexity is not even there. I have full control on the context to generate a necessary prompt (including a fallback prompt to generate common stuff with placeholders). Most of the time when I am not confident, I will go with few-shot approach. For example, the classification of "custom" EL, but I think zero-shot did not work mostly due to the AI (1) changing the input => the unmapped issue and (2) bad format => lesson learnt: respond with json is great.

			- Working with Vietnamese costs tons of token. Why there isn't a telex converter like [what](https://github.com/keymastervn/htksupport/blob/master/string_helper.rb#L5-L72) I made as one simple optimisation. So "Đạt" is just recognised as "DDajt" and is counted as 1 token?
