- stress = tension + pressure
	- tension: the choice of two or more things
		- SHOULD BE: instead of giving out some options, say: option A is preferred but you can try option B, do you want to know the reason of choosing A? When you are young and getting a tension, asking for advice or building a growth-mindset.
	- pressure: one big heavy thing placed on a timing, or right above your head
		- SHOULD BE: if it is avoidable, avoid or underestimate it, don't overthink. If it is inevitable, build your muscle, mentality, accept the aftermath, be cool and bold to weight up yourself. Or accept that you are defeated, feel ashamed to gain a high motivation which leads to a stronger muscle, stronger mentality NOT avoidance. No one can avoid some kinds of pressure because it's a doom, a heat-seeking missile, a timed bomb.
