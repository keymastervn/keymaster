	- There are differences in attachment types, bosses want employees to attach to more values, employees want to attach to money - a transactional freedom
		- because employee at the worst scenario: survived with money, it is likely also because, employees don't have much money than employers
			- "much money" here in a economic perspective is all about risks and possibilities. All people have to learn about finance, to keep their needs meet a safe line between high and low cost of living. It is not comfortable to enjoy life with a significant amount of risks and money (role play: boss)
		- because employers couldn't pay as much money as possible to keep employees, that "keep" is an attachment, they have to think broader, not just money
			- unless employees want to keep the similar attachment, like, they choose to form a relationship with employers (OR most of the time, other employees, or culture). Then it's time to talk about values such as respect: a good mutual manner.
				- trust me, respect is a very hard to understand concept. Maybe you can't tell your boys what respect is without (first - discripline) a rod, then (time) wait, then (feelings) love, hate, rejection
		- the problem is complex, if you choose money they can give you money, it is a simple thing. But some hoomans will choose the other form of attachment because they believe in some things that are perhaps more beautiful (aka. art) than money.
		- I choose both, why I have to opt into one side? Economy is simple, culture is simple, eat first because your body is working for yourself. Try being a good employee and a good boss, a good boss is also another one's employee, they definitely believe in more beautiful things and no wonder they don't force you to buy it.
