	- war is not a game, you can't play dead because there is always a confirm k!ll. When you stand, it is not you today it will be you in another day.
	- you are accepted to be an armchair general, everybody on youtube is a general. Remember don't be a jerk.
	- About this fight: recon is super important. With drone scouting, you won 100% because your enemy plans are 100% failed or it isn't a won fight. "The best leaders know how to pick their battles".
		- Strategically, you can plan to lose many battle to bluff your enemy to all-in and lose a major battle, but at skirmish level you can't say that. You don't want to sacrify comrades.

		- RU: lack of proper counterattack (with one line of trees terrain, it is hard to propose a flank attack - only face-to-face), proper preparation (lack of Z and L trenches). Totally surpised with no artillery support: even when I play Ukr, I won't advance without knowing whether my next steps are coordinated, but Ukr do it.
			- I might say it is a weakspot identified by recon.
	- Don't mistep 4:30 13:20, it's overconfident, getting cover and cover your comrades is first principle.
	- 19:27, as recon there are 4 men hidding on a trench, then Ukr called a tank. These RU should run another line of defense.

	- as organized under BTG, RU could only attack and they couldn't hold occupied land, a long context on how soldiers couldn't be deployed out of RU.
		- They were lack of necessary ground forces to split frontline and safe zone.
		- How they lost elite units by a compensation campaign post Cold-war era which deepened the contradictions within a large organization.
		- Good laws at peace time are not good law in war time. AND, it is hard to change a made law tightened with social benefits.
			- National Guard force is a good move by Putin, but it trade inconsistencies in leadership (a big risk in chaos time) for flexibility in action. I think "polite men" in Crimea were National Guard
		- "2 đại đội Vệ binh Quốc gia Nga đã cầm cự trong gần 1 tuần cho tới khi được quân đội tới cứu viện và rút khỏi thành phố.  Tiếp đó, quân Nga liên tục rút khỏi các thành phố mà họ phải rất vất vả mới chiếm được trong 2 tháng trước đó và để lại một vùng rộng lớn cho Ukraine.  Điểm sáng duy nhất cho quân Nga là không một đơn vị nào của họ bị bao vây và tiêu diệt.  Tuy nhiên, điều đáng ngạc nhiên là không có những trận đánh lớn, đẫm máu xảy ra.  Quân Nga rút nhanh và mang theo tất cả những thứ có thể, kể cả những người dân Ukraine có khả năng sẽ bị phía bên kia trả thù vì hợp tác với người Nga.  Chiến dịch phản công của Ukraine dừng ở đường đứt màu nâu vào tháng 9/2022." => to plan for a reasonable defeat, well done Dvornikov - Zhidko
			- the next part is also a brilliant move, social manipulate by Putin. I don't buy it as a "planned strategic defeat", but it looks like a strategic defeat to buy public opinion OR Putin had a good move to direct it to what he wanted - brilliant, "best leaders know how to lose" as well
				- I don't buy it, but it did happen. At that time I also blamed RU on stupid moves.
