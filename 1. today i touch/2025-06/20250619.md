	- He straightforwardly addressed AIPAC, which has been the major driven force of the US policies.
	- "If Trump were to win a second term, he would likely contemplate invading Iran.  While an initial invasion would seem successful, American forces would quickly become bogged down in Iran's mountainous terrain."
	- "The American invasion would be similar to Athens' invasion of Sicily in 415 BCE, as described in Thucydides' The Peloponnesian War.  Despite its initial successes, the Athenians couldn't re-supply themselves, and their entire expedition was wiped out."
	- "This disastrous defeat turned the war in Sparta's favor, and spelled the downfall of the Athenian empire."

	- "The chief executive of Gulf + Western complained to the station that the program was "virulently anti-business if not anti-American," and that the stationâ€™s carrying the program was not the behavior "of a friend" of the corporation. The London Economist says that "Most people believe that WNET would not make the same mistake again.""
	- "**DICHOTOMIZATION** AND PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGNS"
		- Politicians, most if not ALL of them, think justice is crafted by superpower and narrative, hence they keep a distance from justice advocates/stories. These people are stuck deeply in the binary mindset, they lose their ability to think when they sense the balance of power, they are very sensitive to political territories. That's how evil exists because justice as a foundation virtue is shadowed.
	- Why "Power tends to corrupt"? Why? I think I know it, not just one type of corruptions.
		- I judge people based on their corruption. They may say "hey in life it's no good or bad" and as long as they don't commit evil (or unlawful) things, it's fine. I always judge them based on their purposes and how they do it. I won't say them good or bad anymore, instead, I'll say they will corrupt that way because lacking of virtue.
- It takes me a lot of time to seek the fountainhead of knowledge. I don't have teachers, actually, I am the teacher myself. Key Master himself, is an inner temple holding all my pains from the moment I came to life, is a teacher as well. I am an inner child inside it.
	- I am also seek grandmasters, however, I don't bring what they want and they don't give what I need shortly, they are on purposes and by purposes I am very different from modern men.
	- In the pre-AI era, it took me a lot of time to find real knowledge: philosophy, math, art, psychology,... even politics. There were forums where people deliberately give their best knowledge about something, and I learn a lot. The internet, when the search engine was good, it helped a lot as well.
		- Now we are living in the AI era, everything is accessible. Still, you need to ask the right questions for things you want to learn. But it is tremendously easier than before (when AI is still good and free, haha). But I guess modern human are not interested in pure knowledge and virtue, anymore. It forces a defensive mode in likeminded people, so we are disconnected.
