	- "That's where the problems started. When the leadership made the decision to hire the Rust developers, the director responsible for the decision was in favour of expanding Rust usage, but when a company grows from 30 to 1000 people in a year, frequent reorgs, team changes, and title changes are inevitable. The new director, responsible for the project at the time it was evaluated for performance, was not happy with it. His biggest problem? **If there was no additional work needed for the service, we had three engineers with nothing to do**!" -> hahaha, the best enemy of excellence is lack of vision.
	- "Why is it painful? That's just the business as usual: business grows, new managers arrive, they do “sensible management decisions” that destroy the ability of company to innovate, then only innovations you see are either new lipsticks on a pig (pigs, in a few case) that they already have or something company buys in the already-developed form… all companies traverse that path, this one just passed it faster than Google, IBM or Microsoft."
		- "Because as some point management **no longer does things that benefit the company and start doing things that benefit them**, personally… this process stops gains from “economy of scale” and makes it possible to have small companies, too." -> that's a bs
		- "When managers are at the helm long-terms plans fly by wayside, but that's not necessarily a bad things: engineers with a vision don't always produce thing that they can then sell (think [Dec Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha)). But managers do and do with certainty, almost guaranteed, is precisely what I wrote: “destroy the ability of company to innovate”." https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kp74t2/comment/mtc5oy4/ -> "They do decisions that **bring more money**. Because that's the only thing they know how to do."

	- The most common way for a managerial software engineer to lose identity and prestige is to stop doing engineer tasks.

		- Thanks SJ because you have been inspiring me a lot and a lot
		- t=1:12 "they (IBM)'ve got 350K people, we've got 6K people that makes you wonder. I think IBM is a national treasure... they, jewel and have a great deal of respect from me. **(a) They've made Apple a lot better, (b) by competing with IBM we've become better and better each month**" -> mindset
		- t=2:00 "he was determined that this team would be free to innovate, unencumbered by Apple's bureaucracy and he led the project himself". Jobs knew it, bureaucracy, process, he knew how to make things with people.
			- "he is a maniac, maniacial genius... he will not allow inadequacies or compromises to exist"
			- "SJ was a catalyst, he gave us space, he sheltered us from the corporate noises"
		- t=2:55 "group of people ... not seasonal professionals"
		- t=4:19 "the greatest people are self-managing people, they don't need to be managed. Once they know what to do, they will figure out how to do it, they don't want to be managed. What they need is **a common vision**, and that's what leadership is. What leadership is is having a vision being able to articulate that so people around you can understand it and getting a consensus on a common vision"
