- One of the bad personalities I've seen through so many people, especially smart people, is that they don't re-evaluate the situation whenever unexpected things come. They'd rather stick to their plan which has checkpoints on which they'll re-evaluate comfortably. They don't care about timing or adaptivity, they overly focus on the plan, perhaps the outcome is no longer important at all.

	- "Crazy to say, but after being behind a bar for almost 20 years you learn how to read people as well as the room, learn how to stay however many steps while moving quick…. Biggest life lesson learned was that people love nothing more than talking about themselves, and while ranting and raving lost in the sauce people will divulge some of their deepest darkest secrets with nothing more than small words and comments to keep them going."

	- https://chomsky.info/20200918/ "Not surprisingly, the rest of the world is concerned, if not appalled. It would be difficult to find a more sober and respected commentator than Martin Wolf of the London _Financial Times_. He writes that the West is facing a serious crisis, and if Trump is re-elected, “this will be terminal.” Strong words, and he is not even referring to the major crises humanity faces."

		- "Noam Chomsky’s Response "To being named 2014 winner of Philosophy Now’s Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity" Naturally I am very pleased to be granted this honour, and to be able to accept this award also in the name of my colleague Edward Herman, the co-author of Manufacturing Consent, who himself has done a great deal of outstanding work on this crucial topic. Of course, we’re not the first people to have addressed it. Predictably, one of the earlier ones was George Orwell. He’s written a not very well known essay that is the introduction of his famous book Animal Farm. It’s not known because it wasn’t published – it was found decades later in his unpublished papers, but it is now available. In this essay he points out that Animal Farmis obviously a satire on the totalitarian enemy; but he urges people in free England to not feel too self-righteous about that, because as he puts it, in England, unpopular ideas can be suppressed without the use of force. He goes on to give examples of what he means, and only a few sentences of explanation, but I think they’re to the point."

	- "Someone who is humble simply thinks that they are not the best, not necessarily that they are the worst but perhaps somewhere in the middle. People who are humble also do not boast of their accomplishments or abilities to others, they don’t rub it in . Humility is often an overlooked trait but here are some reasons why you should try to be more humble."
