	- https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html on: How to do what you love
		- There's another sense of "not everyone can do work they love" that's all too true, however. One has to make a living, and it's hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to that destination:
			- The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don't.
			- The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money to work on things you do.
		- Which route should you take? That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your lifetime) for what you want to do. If you're sure of the general area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route. But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.

	- STRIDE as a Practical Aid
	- "Start simple and keep improving. Run retrospectives after a few sessions. Ask what worked, what didn't, and adapt. Experiment with different diagrams, try domain-specific threat libraries, and connect with the wider threat modeling community. Remember - no team has ever found this “too hard” when approached step by step."
