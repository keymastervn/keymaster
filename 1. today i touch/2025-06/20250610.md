- Though I am inspired by Steve Jobs a lot, he is more a sale than an engineer hence I am very far from him. My style is more similar to [Erwin Smith](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Erwin_Smith_(Anime)), I am willing to be in the combat to make determinate and honest decisions. Another one I like is Jensen Huang, he is very dedicated into his work and is an excellent engineering team builder, he built Nvidia with a unique culture, he is a mastermind engineer because his vision is very very far from most of us. Andy Groove, some other managers, and famous philosophers are all my teachers, some friends especially when they make mistakes as well.
	- "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure; these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart." -- Steve Jobs, Memento Mori

		- "they are not pawn"
- One of the most afraid things in life is to remove your own recent work. All works if not foundational (bet we never think like that at the first place) must be removed one day, let's do it quicker. Overcome this fear, we will be better.
