		- "Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. These weird guys who overestimate themselves occasionally knock it right out of the park. That's is the very unhappy path of the modern life... I don't want my personal life to be - a bunch of guys who are living in the state of delusion, who happen occasionally to win big, I want the prudent person"
		- Elon Musk is genius, but he doesn't invent anything. He is a sale, a pitch person who knows where the problem lies.

		- "ParadeDB is an alternative that functions as a full-featured PostgreSQL replacement for ElasticSearch. It offloads full-text search and filtering operations to Tantivy and includes BM25 among its features, though it uses a different query and filter syntax than PostgreSQL's native indexes.
		- In contrast, Vectorchord-bm25 focuses exclusively on BM25 ranking within PostgreSQL. We implemented the BM25 ranking algorithm Block WeakAnd from scratch and built it as a custom operator and index (similar to pgvector) to accelerate queries. It is designed to be lightweight and a more native and intuitive API for better full-text search and ranking in PostgreSQL."
		- Well, opensearch supports it.
