	- "Do you use tactics to improve your team's ability to flow?" IS A GOOD QUESTION
	- ""flow" is a state in which your conscious mind/superego stops telling you why you can't do something and lets the rest of your mind/body get it done"
	- [The Meditative Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Varieties_of_the_Meditative_Experience), Daniel Goleman 1977, 1988
		- The key elements of flow are
			- the merging of action and awareness in sustained concentration on the task at hand
			- the focusing of attention in a pure involvement without concern for outcome,
			- self-forgetfulness with heightened awareness of the activity,
			- skills adequate to meet the environmental demand, and
			- clarity regarding situational cues and appropriate response
	- Compared to Csikszentmihalyi

		- In 2008, Csikszentmihalyi updated the Flow Theory to involve nine major components. To experience a sense of flow:
			- A task must be just outside the person's grasp yet believed to be obtainable.
			- The person must be able to focus all their effort and attention on the task.
			- The person needs to receive clear and appropriate immediate feedback for improvement. The feedback needs to include steps for improvement.
			- A person's time spent on the tasks seems effortless to them.
			- The person needs to feel a sense of autonomy over actions.
			- The focus is not on themselves.
			- The experience is not timeless.
			- The experience isÂ **autotelic**.
				- means a person is internally driven and does not need external rewards to be motivated. In an autotelic state of mind, the person is motivated to set goals to achieve a desirable outcome.
	- My acknowledgement: It is the true "Be water, my friend"
	- My flow state has been mostly interrupted by code reviews. At the end, the people have to use trust built to make it better.

		- "would have achieved a 15-hour work week" -> I actually like this idea,  productive jobs are jobs that buy more time and freedom for the worker.
	- "Meaningful problems are the most valuable human motivators" yeah, it triggers flow.
