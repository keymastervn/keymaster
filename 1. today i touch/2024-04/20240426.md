	- Meta-ignorance
	- and their opposites https://wiki.c2.com/?FourLevelsOfCompetence
	- Attitudes fall into a continuum with:
		- At one end, "I am not ignorant!" (I can't accept being ignorant).
		- And at the other, "I understand ignorance is part of the human condition" (I accept that no one person can know everything-even about a single topic!).
		- Perhaps the "orders" are more like a process.
			- You want to solve a problem but are unaware that **there is** **knowledge** that would help.
			- You have a sense that there must be something that will help, but you are unaware of where to find it.
				- Dat: FROM HERE LET'S USE AI BROS, LET'S USE IT, IT IS SOMEHOW FREE TO USE WHEN SEARCH SUCKS
			- You know where it is, but you do not have access to it.
			- You have access to it, but do not understand how to make it work.
			- You get it to work, but find out that it is not what you thought

		- "Many people may be interested in and share their opinions on a project or decision. But only some will be responsible for delivering the project and directly accountable for its success. Everyone may be interested in a bet, but only some players have money to lose."

		- The concepts inside a federated network, to me, are fundamental and indipensable.
	- Bluesky being a federated network means individual users can run their own “Bluesky instance” and curate their own network => reinvent how network works
