	- "When using microservices, you are recommended to keep them loosely coupled, including their data storage. Therefore, materialized views can help you consolidate data from your services. If materialized views are not appropriate in your microservices architecture or specific scenario, please consider having well-defined boundaries that align to [domain driven design (DDD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/tactical-ddd) and aggregate their data when requested."

	- To Kay, not to "organizing code into classes and methods", Object-Oriented is about three things:
		- Messaging (or message-passing);
		- Local retention and protection and hiding of state-process (or encapsulation); and
		- **Extreme late-binding** -> generic, polymorphism?
	- "If we do that with "Object-Oriented Programming" and add a "not" to it, we get "NOT Object-Oriented Programming", and if it's not about object-orientation, what is it about? Well, it seems to be _Messages_. That seems to be the core idea of OOP" -> kudos
