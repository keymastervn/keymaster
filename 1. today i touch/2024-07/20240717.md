		- "Part of the problem is that companies like Google and Microsoft, with whom millions of people sadly still have email accounts, punish companies for sending "bulk mail". If companies use their main domain, their normal corporate email may get blocked by anti-spam filters. Instead they use a different, unrelated domain for bulk mails. Some of the better known companies like Mailchimp specialise in sending bulk mail and have "**arrangements**" with BigTech providers who now act as the gatekeepers of email. But even giant banks, in a bid to save a few pennies, will shop around and use some insanely dodgy third party providers."

	- "A couple of problems I found with Anki for languages:
		- The words aren't in context, which leads to "flashcard blindness", where you see a word in context, know that you recognize it, but can't remember what it means.
		- The theory behind spaced repetition is that you learn most efficiently when you try to remember something just when you're about to forget it. But that means that if the algorithm is working properly, every single card is hard. This makes motivation a problem, because you know studying is going to be a grind, not fun.
		- While "being able to remember it after thinking a second or two" might be fine when studying for an exam, or in many other contexts where memorization might be important, that's too slow for languages. What you want for a language is "know it immediately without having to think about it".
		- The "scheduled review" system is too inflexible. Some days you get only a handful of cards to review, some days you get dozens. It's hard to tell when you're starting out how many cards you should be adding each day such that the number of cards match the amount of time / effort you have to study. Furthermore, if you skip a single day, you have twice as much the next day; and if life happens and you end up missing a week or a month, you come back with a giant jumble of cards, half of which you've forgotten, and it's really difficult to dig your way out of it.
		- By a strange coincidence, in 2019 I also started on an alternate to Anki to help myself study Mandarin. It has some similarities to his system, in that there's multi-level knowledge; but it's different in that instead of having a fixed schedule, it has the concept of "difficulty" and "study value" for each word / grammar concept, and the algorithm tries to give you a full "readunit" of "native input" which will balance the two. "Spaced repetition" emerges naturally from the model, and if you go away for a week (or 6 months), it knows you've forgotten some things, so it gradually refreshes your memory. And because you're reading actual native text, there's something which pulls you in."
