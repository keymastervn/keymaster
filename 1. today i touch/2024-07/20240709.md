- OOP fundamental: Passing argument or not passing argument (using instance var)
	-   if can_send_sms_notification?(user_info)
          send_sms_notification(job, user_id, user_info.first_name, token)
        else
          send_email_notification(job, user_id, token)
        end
	- Pros: convenience if using instance var, BUT IT IS IMPLICIT, when refactoring/copy/paste code, you must look for the variable first

	- "However, like any popular technique, agile software development has suffered fromÂ [semantic diffusion](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html), so much of what we see under the name of agile doesn't bear much resemblance to what the early pioneers were doing. So I think it's important to revisit the essential elements of agile thinking."

	- "The other day my wife clicks "Save" in word. A folder comes up that she previously saved to. She types in a new file name. Then says "hey hon, It won't let me save." I see the error. Can't access disk. Immediately I think, well I replaced the HDD with and SSD, so that's probably not the problem. I look at the folder she's accessing, everything looks normal. It shows a bunch of other files in it. I go up a folder and back into the folder, and everything looks great, click Save - > same error again.Finally I go to my computer -> and path my way back all the way into the same folder, click Save. It works and she says thank you!"
	- "Hi"?"I have an error"What error?"It won't compile"Whats the error message?"Function lib.X not found"Did you import the library?"No"Import it"It worked"
		- Haha imho, it should be just 1 WHY and everything is clear
