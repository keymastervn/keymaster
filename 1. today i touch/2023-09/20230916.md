- [Apoliticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoliticism) (absence+politics) is an attitude of the courage and it's not human nature. The rejection towards politics will bring us to hell, so keeping it in control has been a right thing in life.
	- "Mây tụ theo tầng, vật tụ theo loài". That movement creates cities and societies. Con người là động vật xã hội, lạc đàn đồng nghĩa với sống mòn hoặc chết.
	- When we party, it forms political alliance to vacuum interests. The size of our party (1) and the volume of interests (2) create conflicts as the resources are never unlimited (or easy to be depleted). There can be "mono-duo-trio, or less than 42 +poly" or there can be catastrophic conflicts that make the game and context vulnerable.
	- So when people's tendency to group is inevitable
		- keep them small to fix (1) by
			- Having proper ownership planning AND agile units (5-9) at most
			- Rotation to break the party more often
		- fix (2) by
			- Resources planning: maybe resources distribution 70, resources for vacuum 30, also the way they are paid really matters
				- https://www.workrules.net/ to "pay unfairly". GG23 may costs 4k$ each pax and it motivates people with good distribution. Reapra also learns deeply about human dynamics, resources for vacuum even given precisely to the people may demotivate them.
			- Make the cost of teaming outweigh the cost of vacuuming SO it does not scale well.
			- Or perhaps create observable units to make them counter each other, but this approach has a side-effect for small-scale conflicts (it is approachable when the organisation are worse already. If everything is good, conflicts will prevent a certain level of cooperation, you don't want the org to be down from great to average)
		- make the org resilient to all damage: a self-healing approach :lmao:
			- I don't believe much in this, "too big to fail" becomes "too long to fail" just because bureaucracy is a slow effect. Everything can be a failure, every system including democracy, monarchy, theocracy... can fail though leadership sometimes tries to mix them up to create a different socio-context.
			- societies love democracy because it creates resiliency, but there are fragility-at-heart mechanisms that enroot mediocrity, decorated corruption and eventually bring a whole society to hell.
			- Reapra has a concept "Build to last" which focus on how Japanese has so many 400 years old businesses. But how? "Sustainable" and ["ccws"](https://book.reapra.com/01-chapter1.html#ccws%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E8%BF%BD%E6%B1%82%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9A%E7%BE%A9) instead of being "monopoly". It is very theorical.
	- Even an evil person can be placed in certain places. Good carpenters know how to use all kinds of wood.
	- Good people are brave and lovely, they may find a "blue ocean" space instead of vacuuming resources. Kent Beck has an idea about "incentive" https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/incentives-money -> to be loved and lovely.
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqfbzXM7imo if your living is't to identify and conquer your fears, you will soon vacuum yourself with the greed of resources you take. Don't worry as the young generations will break every hard things to keep it make sense because we oldmen are making no sense at all, in this competition.
- https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/28/the-working-from-home-delusion-fades "Those working at home were 18% less productive than their peers in the office"
	- I personally believe that working in the office has productivity benefits: less context-switch, more focused, smooth communication also as super easy to get colleague supports. But the costs of going to office is causing many life issues: housing, lacking of baby/parental-caring, traffic, ofc employee time plus the employer has to spend office rental fee. Communication and "discipline" (or specifically "key result deliverables" over "fake effort") play a vital role in implementing remote working.
		- But practically, you can't use the company time for doing personal things, it's simply unethical. When you make a pact that you can use company time for your personal time AND at your personal time you are doing company work in compensation, it results in working more hours and more chaos in your work-life context => so you have to cultivate "discipline".
- The triads: Staff Engineer, Engineering Manager and Technical program manager. It's mentioned by PragmaticEngineer much frequently.
