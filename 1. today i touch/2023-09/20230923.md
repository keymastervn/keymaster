		- He actually mentions [first principles](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles), in case you don't know about it: a mental model to cut unnecessary things by self-doubting fundamental things
		- t=300 "you want a company as small as possible, it needs to be as large as necessary to do the job well"
		- "the most seniors need the least management"
		- t=480 "how about your leadership style change over time?" -> "it's just me"... "if something is not right, I am just say it" "and then I spend a lot of time reasoning through my decision because they learn how leaders think through the problems"
		- t=667 "top five-things", it looks like [Grit](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/psychology/grit/) but not focusing on accomplishment but concentration.
			- [read _Drive_ by Dan Pink](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/drive/) => Well, Dan Pink has a very very quality talk on the topic Motivation, I would suggest everyone hear [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y) once.

Huang also says that "strategy is action, not words" and "the top-five things" can be unwillingly out of strategies.

		- t=1014 "the most important thing, is to not cause people to have to do commodity work" lmao, he advises people to walk away from comoditized businesses. Well, he mentions about sharing information away from "knowledge silos"
			- Here comes the word "transparent". Which I think, it is not about sharing 100% all the stupid things BUT only the important, impactful things.
			- "empowering is everybody can go to a meeting and contribute, including a new colledge grad" -> 1000% agree
	- "Great post, Rowan. A lot of Catalyst-like indicators here. Catalyst leaders work on creating an organizational CULTURE that is empowering and collaborative, realizing that shaping the culture takes more than the right structure and procedures. The emphasis in the discussion is on structural and procedural matters. Would have liked more discussion about the culture."
