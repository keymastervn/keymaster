		- "The core ideas behind Mastodon and Lemmy is called the fediverse. Rather than full decentralization, those applications rely on federation, in the sense that there still are servers and clients (so it's not p2p like ssb, Dat and IPFS), but there is a galaxy of servers chatting with each other instead of having central servers controlled by a single entity (like Facebook or Reddit)."
		- The basic idea is that an `actor` will send and receive `activities`, which are structured JSON messages with well defined properties, but extensible to cover any need. An actor is defined by four endpoints
			- `GET /inbox` : used by the actor to find new activities intended for them.
			- `POST /inbox` : used by instances to push new activities intended for the actor.
			- `GET /outbox` : used by anyone to read the activities created by the actor.
			- `POST /outbox` : used by the actor to publish new activities.
		- It's basically an internet with micro-messages as events to hook to each host. The "server" is never centralized so you can trust a small/medium tech companies instead of tech giants.
			- Thinking about having a mastodon profile and you subscribe on an entity/actor eg. a tomato plant and you continuously receive its message to your inbox AND you will buy them when they are ready. It's an end-to-end flow without internet's authorities.
			- You know, many government-related sectors eg. hospitals, schools are blocked by "relying on the giant technology". It's a politics-safe approach because you simply can't trust eg. Microsoft or Google but the US-government. The data inside is sensitive (specifically, national secrets by law), so the server must be placed inside hospitals and schools. The data is there as well, it is not ON-PREMISE and is internet-unlocked by the above simple protocol, the server can be upgraded under new reviewed spec, by Secure Design-compliant instead of Cloud-hosted-compliant (-> lol they say if you put your data inside my data center, it is 100% safe -> how stupid these certificates are)
			- If I startup in tech right now, I will either (1) create an ed-tech ecosystem with Web 3 or (2) build a software (legalTech) for microinvestment which can turn all businesses into investable entities -> this is a hard problem.
