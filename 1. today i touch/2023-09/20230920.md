Socio-context changes, it's bad for real-estate owners but it's good for the country. Answer one question: why we have to keep our asses centered to a city to work, then spend a huge bill on centering our asses? Some will say it's a demand to resources including education, work, healthcare... But it misaligns you to other resources (your family, your caring time, the beautiful and melancholic hometown) at the same time

- When I focus on some things for at least a week, it creates repetitions, and the amazing thing is I do it naturally without realising that I've recently thought about eg. "remote working". I don't know how it is but I usually end up reading the similar topics to what I've been thinking of. Maybe the topics are mainstreamed, or the volume I touch daily is high, or maybe I intentionally dive deep and frequently into just one topic.
	- I don't know if Justin mentioned about this or not, but I strongly believe the best time to study (re-enforce learning) is the moment right after the lesson. If a teacher allows students to forget and study the lesson immediately, the student will have better result IMHO. But how to forget and study at a time, I think, it is to teach 2 lessons A, B at once.
		- lesson A will be revised at the end of lesson B in one session, while B should be a homework.
		- planning is important here, also B should be a less important lesson. Most importantly, the student must be aware of the method so they will have consent (to themselves)
		- In my school journey, the best teachers seems to be those who jumped directly into a lesson, then spending rest of the time to tell jokes, then coming back to the lesson. It was very relaxing.

	- https://www.edapp.com/blog/how-to-use-active-recall-and-spaced-repetition/ but again, this focus on "remembering" which is a low-order thinking. 
		- If you don't possess the ability to forget knowledge, your learning will be slowed down. If your knowledge is 90% useless, you are an expert because it is 97% useless for most people. We in life focus on making it relevant for not being useless.
			- Bias, as our knowledge pools are not equivalent
		- I personally don't think Philosophy is useless in Software Engineering, though at its very naive concept they are two irrelevant things. In a highly cognitive thinking, everything is connected; we choose to **actively forget** things under a certain threshold, but we still keep the connection because the threshold will comfortably change.
