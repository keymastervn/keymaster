- The hard problems aka https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity) are problems having many unknown-unknowns while the unknowns are seemingly co-related.
	- In an NP problem, there can be some Ps as child problems
	- Some human problems are very hard, because we can't control human. But it doesn't mean that solving a human problem is harder than solving a technical problem because unknown can be known and "hard" is just a qualitative word
		- But the human problems are still considered as a hard because human always change, context A is always A'. While technical problems are usually context-locked and more often, someone has gone before to lead the way
	- Doing businesses is actually working with human's needs. The society tends to split problems into solvable (P) and unsolvable (NP). In economics, the reward system is need-based. Solvable businesses (P) are congested in a red ocean where solving the problem is not the utmost goal to win; hence, there is a tendency towards gambling and politics which adds NPs to the game, flushing out then context being simplified to P.
		- So while NP and P are intertwined, at the end of the day, we are all moving to solving NP problems before having enough power to switch the context - yeah - monopoly or triopoly. We can't stop the movement: 1-2-3-42-1, I wish we all live well and be thoughtful.
	- Choosing to solve the right problem is a skill, don't worry, solving problems always creates problems.
