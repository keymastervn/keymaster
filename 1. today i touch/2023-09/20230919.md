	- "Unfortunately, coming up with a good version solving algorithm is hard. _Really hard_. [**NP-hard**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness). Which, for anyone who’s not an algorithms nerd, means it’s so difficult that it’s a major unanswered question in computer science whether an efficient algorithm even exists¹."
		- Similar to interview assessments, it seems easy with least evaluation but tremendously hard when evaluating at reasonable metrics. Least evaluation treats geniuses as potential people, while potential ones are being treated as fishes climbing a tree.
	- "Most researchers believe [there is no universally efficient algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Reasons_to_believe_P_%E2%89%A0_NP) for problems like version solving, but proving it is so difficult that no one’s managed it despite a million dollar bounty."
