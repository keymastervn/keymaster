Those who are themselves are very "misaligned", plus engineers should be honest.
	- [Facebook the company is still focused on “what’s your ‘impact'”](https://rackandstack-tech.blog/2019/10/15/kent-beck-fired-from-facebook/#:~:text=But%20what%20if%20there%20are%20downsides) -> "At some point Facebook needs to switch to focusing on impact to focusing on the quality of decisions"
		- So Kent was fired for leveraging up the review to its next level: making just good decisions. A big sigh, I want to drop Hegel's dialectical reasoning here.
	- Off topic, no more productivity!

	- Dynamic-typed language is an invention, like OOP after functional programming. It's like taking an AK that does not fucking care about either 5.56mm or 7.62mm or mag12, mag30, the engineers care everything and you just learn how to tap... it's not a retro movement dude, it's a revolution. Your stupid in unethical programming bites you with discipline from programming language tools.
