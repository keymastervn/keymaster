Everything should come with a plan to become an idea.
Communicate by sharing the plan, if you failed to plan, then you plan to fail.
Don't tell, take action. Without a plan, then no action.

To plan, you must evaluate the fact context, the future context.
The definition of success, the scope, the exit plan, the backup / rollback plan, the likelihood.
