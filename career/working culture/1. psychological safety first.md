You have to put it on top of your traits, people must feel OK when working with you. Though it seems very subjective, you must try answering: am I as a career starter feel comfortable when working with me at this moment?

It is not about being positive, being nice all the time, it is about feeling good and the problems are considered and handled then at the end of the day it doesn't break you or the team.

Psychological safety guarantees if you don't want to speak up, it's an okay, you can try another way of communication because it boils down to be on the same page. If you don't want to lead, it's another okay because it boils down to heading to the same goal and no one gets block, or if you want to lead, consider a talk and it's is just okay. Unlike to be happy/positive which is not based on the work to-be done, psychological safety guarantees everybody can contribute, be recognized and is treated equally towards a goal while in front of them is somebody's back. Psychological safety doesn't expect you to be a superman also, you are allowed to be human and reach your potential.

Be objective, be teamwork and embrace challenges as growth opportunities.
