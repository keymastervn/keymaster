[RFC-6265](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265)
- Cookie-based authentication
	- https://lwn.net/Articles/380058/
- (1) Encrypt "data" at the backend side, (2)attach the encrypted data to frontend side through login endpoint, (3)decrypt it back at the backend side when frontend calling requests to backend.
	- symmetric key (single host), not a [public-key encryption system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) so you no private key management (mostly, depends)
	- "data" is mostly a piece of data ie. user_id, not context data
	- backend is the writer and the reader, FE is validated as trusted origin (CORS)
- A long-lived session, usually TTL is 1 day -> forever through `Max-Age`, or `Expires`
	- Applicable for mobile, long session once the client is physically controlled
- Can be invalidated, if you store the encryption key uniquely for "data" (ie. update user session token)
- In practical, depends on user agent implementations we have [Limits](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265#:~:text=Considerations%0A%0A6.1.-,Limits,-Practical%20user%20agent)
