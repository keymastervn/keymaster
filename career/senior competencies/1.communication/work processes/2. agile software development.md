The _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_ is based on twelve principles: [[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#cite_note-ManifestoPrinciples-23)

1.  Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3.  Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4.  Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5.  Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6.  Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress
8.  Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10.  Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11.  Best [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Architecture "Agile Architecture"), requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12.  Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

## Embrace agile

High-level estimation
- epic
	- When you create the epic, make an update to the roadmap
- story
Low-level estimation
- task
- subtask

## Scrum
TBD

# Card definition
(a suggestion for JIRA)

| Epic     	| Large pieces of work that involves multiple stories. Epics should have a limit to scope and a delivery date. Usually come with an Inception document.                                                                                                                                               	| Stories (supported in JIRA)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	| By roadmap planning                                                                                                 	|
| Story    	| Small unit of development which proposes a change in functionality or new capability.  The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value to the customer.                                                   	| As a  I want  So that Requirements: Example: Must have x Example: Clicking y opens z Testable outcome (or Acceptance Criteria):  Given that [some context], when [some action is carried out], then [a set of observable outcomes should occur]. Link to USM  Link to Inception doc 	| 1, 2, 3, 5 story point Anything over 5 SP we should question whether this can be broken down into multiple stories. 	|
| Task     	| Tasks are work items that are not directly related to a user requirement but still must be completed.                                                                                                                                                      	| Why are we doing this task?

| Sub-task 	| Sub-tasks are children tasks that can be associated with either a Task or a Story. Use to break your work items into detail for better clarity on what to do.  Sub-task should be preferred for Pull Request to keep the changes small and easy to deploy. 	| Context (if-any) Follow-ups (if-any)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	| 1, 2 story point                                                                                                    	|
