The _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_ is based on twelve principles: [[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#cite_note-ManifestoPrinciples-23)

1.  Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3.  Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4.  Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5.  Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6.  Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress
8.  Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10.  Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11.  Best [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Architecture "Agile Architecture"), requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12.  Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
