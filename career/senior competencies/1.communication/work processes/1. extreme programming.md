Two major influences shaped software development in the 1990s:

-  Internally, [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") replaced [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming") as the programming paradigm favored by some developers.
-  Externally, the rise of the Internet and the [dot-com boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_boom "Dot-com boom") emphasized speed-to-market and company growth as competitive business factors.

Rapidly changing requirements demanded shorter [product life-cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_life_cycle_management "Product life cycle management"), and often clashed with traditional methods of software development.
