## Why code review?
FAQ in many interviews: how do you think about code review?

> above code review ~> peer code review

--- 

### For knowledge sharing

A platform so A can navigate B through ideas with "right" or "wrong"

--- 

### For quality keeper 1/2
Most managers care about the output, means the **features** in term of functionalities/non-functionalities more than people.

--- 

### For quality keeper 2/2

Of course, it does. Super effective in a no QAs organisation.

- Spot out coding issues eg. conventions, race conditions
- Maintainability, someone won't feel f\*ck up when taking ownership
- Error prone on boundary cases
- Etc...

---
### The most organic way to build relationships in the office
As working on the same thing, trust me bro.

---
### To validate yourself
A life in fulfillment is a life in adequate verification

---
## Who involves in code review?

Of course, code `reviewer` and `reviewee`

# Code Review for Reviewer

![[Pasted image 20230217143643.png|400]]

---
## What is the code doing?

*It usually begins with a ticket.*

Ask yourself
- Do you have the right background info?
- Do you fully understand why this code is needed?
- Do you understand how this code fits into the project?

---
## Test the code

Ask yourself
- Does the code have appropriate unit-tests?
- Does CI generate warnings or errors?
- Does the code have any real results in staging?

--- 
## Inspect the code 1/2

Check and ask the owner
- Convention, styles
- Implementation matches to expectation
	- Changes that break existing features
	- Changes that block future enhancement
	- Changes that is repeated, not DRY

---
## Inspect the code 2/2

- Insights, *yes, everything can be insighted subjectively*
	- Well-design
	- Complexity
	- Consistency
	- Documentation in needed

# Code Review for Reviewee
Why not doing self-review first?

## Self-Review Checklist
*it depends on your domain: backend, frontend, infra, architect*

Let's take a [look](https://employmenthero.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/pages/2482962686/Self-Review+Checklist), TLDR;

---

## Self-elaborate Comments
<s>Show, don't tell</s>
Tell, don't ask

It's a sign that you care about your reviewer

--- 

# Ethnic
Don't be a bit too dark, software must be **happy ending** more than *drama*.

Rule 1: Always be constructive
Rule 2: Most of the time, you welcome replies as constructive feedback

--- 

## Represent your self
‚ùå
This code block is not understandable
This code block is so confusing
‚úÖ
I can't understand this code block, could you please explain what's the purpose behind?
I am confused about the reason this line of code is placed here?

---

## Be rationale
‚ùå
Backend is not ready yet so this will crash the system if you have it merged
‚úÖ
For this release, I'd suggest you have the backend PR merged first, then following up by this one
üåü(Better)
As the backend is not ready yet, how about adding a flag to control and release once it is ready? To me it is safer.

---

## Question not demand
‚ùå
You are using hash which is not efficient, you will change to set, won't you?
‚úÖ
AFAIK, using a hash is neither a solid interface nor bad memory GC, the Set data structure is well supported for this kind of requirement.
üåü(Better)
Here is benchmark whereas Set is x% efficient in iops/mem, also less LOC. \`\`\`suggestion 

---

## Be objective
‚ùå
You should use this function when getting to init the component.
‚úÖ
In order to handle errors better, let's use this function as it has rich content on errors so you can render it to the user, or treat the unhappy cases differently.

--- 

## Avoid judgemental words
‚ùå
Function XYZ is obviously the same as ABC
‚úÖ
I believe function ABC can provide the same functionality could you check it, please?

---

## Expect misunderstandings
‚ùå
I can't understand what this code does... totally confused! Why?
‚úÖ
Can you elaborate on this piece of code? I guess it yields the same result but I can't make sure of it.

---

# Be a part of the Culture
Code review is hard.
My code reviewer is a gift.

So, I will send it to another one, says the *Law of Cause and Effect*
