## Game theory classics

_which fits my brain, for every "game"_

Player settings:
- 2 players
- n players

Action settings:
- Basic - duality: yes/no, left/right, coop/deflect (matrix of 2)
- Advance - usually three: against, compromise, avoid (matrix of N)

Game settings:
- Cooperative / non-cooperative
  - coop: negotiation or agreements
  - non-coop: maximize profit for them, or for the game.
- Symmetric / asymmetric
- Zero-sum / non-zero-sum (with negative value)
  - sum outcomes of all player is not zero
- Simultaneous / sequential (turn-based)
  - do or do not know about others move

Outcome rules:
- Basic: Capture the flag/FFA
- Mode: winner takes all

Game rules:
- Finite, infinite (assumed big)
- Big game contains smaller games.

Player strategy: depends, but for basic, 1v1, round robin, follows this process
- Identify the players
- Define the strategies
- Analyze the payoffs
- Nash eq
- Optimize strategies
